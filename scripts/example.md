Class A:
def a():
    print('a')
    b()
    c()
    
def b():
    print('b')
    c()
    
    
 this is method a

 gpt says ok lets see the method body, it checks and says this is not enough, i need to look at other methods,

 we say ok method a calls b and c, which one you think you need to see

 it says ok i will neeed to see method b

 it looks and gets method body using an api

 then looks and analyze and thiks its the buggy method



# bug report: the problem happens in the method a() when i pass bla bla.......


search_method_in_class ("a,", "A'")
ans:
    ```
    def a():
    print('a')
    b()
    ```
    
"Based on your analysis, answer below questions:"
"\n- do we need more context: construct search API calls to get more context of the project. (leave it empty if you don't need more context)"
"\n- where are bug locations: buggy files and methods. (leave it empty if you don't have enough information)"

ans: no this info is not enough to find the bug location. 

ok so from call graph info method a calls b and c
