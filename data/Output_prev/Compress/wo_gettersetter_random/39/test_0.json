However, there is no explicit indication of suspicious behavior in the provided code snippets. The `sanitize` method seems to be performing a string sanitization operation, which is generally a safe operation, while the constructors of `ArchiveStreamFactory` are standard initializations.\n\nSince there is no clear basis for ranking the methods in terms of suspicion, I will assume that the methods are equally non-suspicious based on the information provided. Therefore, I will return an empty list as there are no suspicious methods to rank.\n\n```json\n[]\n```"
