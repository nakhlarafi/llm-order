    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, the methods can be ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious based on their involvement in the test failure and the complexity of their logic. The `binomialCoefficient` method is directly related to the test that failed, while the other methods are utility methods that support it. Here\u2019s the ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nNote: The ranking is based on the assumption that the methods are ranked primarily by their direct involvement in the test failure and their complexity. The `binomialCoefficient` method is the most suspicious as it directly relates to the test that failed, followed by the supporting methods. The last few entries are repeated for clarity, but they should be unique in a real scenario."
