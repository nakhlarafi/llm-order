    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, the methods can be ranked according to the frequency and nature of the exceptions thrown during the tests. The tests indicate that the constructor of `ElitisticListPopulation` is being called with invalid parameters, leading to `OutOfRangeException`. The methods that are directly related to these tests will be considered more suspicious.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this ranking:\n- `method_id` 0 corresponds to the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor, which is directly involved in the tests that are failing due to invalid elitism rates.\n- `method_id` 1 corresponds to the `ListPopulation` constructor, which is also related but less directly involved in the specific tests that are failing."
