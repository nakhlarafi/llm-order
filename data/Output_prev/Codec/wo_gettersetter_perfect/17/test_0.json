Here\u2019s the ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 0** (`newStringIso8859_1`): This method directly caused the NullPointerException when it was called with a null input.\n2. **Method ID 1** (`newString`): This method is responsible for handling the null check but is still involved in the call chain that leads to the exception.\n3. **Method ID 2** (`newStringUtf8`): This method is less suspicious as it does not directly cause the exception but is part of the same utility class.\n4. **Method ID 3** (`newString`): This method is the least suspicious as it is a utility method that is not directly involved in the exception but is part of the overall functionality. \n\nThe ranking reflects the methods' direct involvement in the exception and their handling of null inputs."
