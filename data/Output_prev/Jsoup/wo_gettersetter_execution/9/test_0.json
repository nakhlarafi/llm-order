Since there are no other methods listed to compare against, I will rank this method as the only one present.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nIf there were more methods to analyze, I would rank them accordingly based on their suspiciousness. However, with the current data, this is the only method available."
