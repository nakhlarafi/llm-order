Here is the ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 7** (`toStringEquals`): Directly involved in the NullPointerException as it is called in the stack trace.\n2. **Method ID 1** (`matches`): Related to the matching logic and could be involved in handling null values.\n3. **Method ID 0** (`getSuspiciouslyNotMatchingArgsIndexes`): The method being tested, which is directly related to the test case.\n4. **Method ID 8** (`safelyMatches`): Also involved in the matching process, which could lead to null handling issues.\n5. **Method ID 9** (`describe`): Involved in generating descriptions, which may also handle null values.\n6. **Method ID 3** (`validate`): Part of the validation process, which could indirectly relate to the issue.\n7. **Method ID 4** (`validateState`): Similar to Method ID 3, involved in state validation.\n8. **Method ID 5** (`validateState`): Another validation method, less directly related to the issue.\n9. **Method ID 6** (`validateState`): Similar to Method IDs 4 and 5, but less relevant.\n10. **Method ID 10** (`GlobalConfiguration` constructor): Least suspicious as it is a constructor and not directly involved in the matching logic."
