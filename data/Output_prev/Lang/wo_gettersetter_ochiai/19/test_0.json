The methods that are directly involved in the exception or are related to the translation process are considered more suspicious.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this ranking:\n- Method ID 0 (`NumericEntityUnescaper:translate`) is ranked the highest because it is the method where the exception occurs.\n- Method ID 1 (`CharSequenceTranslator:translate(CharSequence, Writer)`) is next as it is involved in the translation process and could potentially lead to the exception.\n- Method ID 2 (`CharSequenceTranslator:translate(CharSequence)`) is ranked third as it is a higher-level method that calls the other methods but is less directly involved in the exception."
