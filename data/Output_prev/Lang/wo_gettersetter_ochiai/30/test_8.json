    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, the test case `testContainsNone_CharArrayWithBadSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion error, indicating that the expected result does not match the actual result. This suggests that there may be an issue with the method `containsNone` in the `StringUtils` class.\n\nThe suspiciousness can be ranked based on the following criteria:\n1. The failure of the test indicates a potential bug in the method being tested.\n2. The complexity of the method and the edge cases it handles can also contribute to its suspiciousness.\n\nGiven that we only have one method (`containsNone`) that is directly related to the test case, we can rank it as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThis indicates that the `containsNone` method is the most suspicious due to the failed assertion in the test case. If there were more methods involved, they would be ranked accordingly based on their relation to the failure and their complexity."
