    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, the test method `testContainsNone_StringWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `true` but received `false`. This indicates a potential issue with the `containsNone` method from the `StringUtils` class. \n\nGiven that the failure occurs in the context of testing the `containsNone` method, we can infer that this method is the most suspicious. However, since we only have one method in the context of the provided information, we will rank it accordingly.\n\nHere is the JSON output reflecting the ranking of the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nIn this case, `method_id` 0 corresponds to the `containsNone` method, which is ranked as the most suspicious due to the test failure."
