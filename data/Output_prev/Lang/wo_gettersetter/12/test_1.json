This indicates that there is a potential issue with how the indices are being calculated or used within the method. The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils.random` is directly implicated in the stack trace.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, there is only one method involved in the stack trace that is causing the issue, hence it is ranked as the most suspicious."
