    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, the test case `testContainsNone_StringWithSupplementaryChars` has failed due to an assertion error, indicating that the expected output does not match the actual output. This suggests that there may be an issue with the `containsNone` method in the `StringUtils` class.\n\nSince we only have one method (`containsNone`) mentioned in the context of the test failure, we can rank it as the most suspicious method. However, without additional methods to compare against, we can only provide a single entry in the ranking.\n\nHere is the JSON output for the most suspicious method:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nIf there were more methods or context provided, we could rank additional methods accordingly."
