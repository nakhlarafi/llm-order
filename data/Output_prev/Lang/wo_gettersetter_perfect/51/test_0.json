This exception indicates that there may be issues with how the method handles strings of varying lengths, especially those that are shorter than expected.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, there is only one method (`toBoolean`) that is directly associated with the exception, making it the most suspicious. If there were more methods involved, they would be ranked accordingly based on their potential to cause similar issues."
