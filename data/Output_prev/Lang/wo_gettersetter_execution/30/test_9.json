The suspiciousness can be inferred from how the method interacts with edge cases, particularly with supplementary characters and the handling of null values.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, there is only one method (`containsNone`) that is being tested, and it is marked as the most suspicious due to the complexity of handling supplementary characters and potential edge cases that could lead to unexpected behavior."
