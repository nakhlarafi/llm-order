    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test body and the covered methods, we can analyze the methods for potential issues. The methods are ranked based on how suspicious they appear, considering factors such as null handling, edge cases, and the complexity of the input data.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 1**: This method has a more complex signature that includes start and end indices. The handling of these indices can lead to off-by-one errors or unexpected behavior if not properly managed, especially with mixed types and null values.\n  \n2. **Method ID 0**: This method is simpler and only handles the array and separator. However, it still needs to handle null arrays properly, which is a common source of bugs. \n\nBoth methods are suspicious due to their handling of null values and the potential for unexpected behavior with mixed data types, but Method ID 1 is ranked higher due to its additional complexity."
