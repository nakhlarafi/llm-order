The suspiciousness can be inferred from how many times the method is called with invalid inputs and whether it throws the expected exceptions.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, there is only one method (`LocaleUtils.toLocale`) being tested, and it is called multiple times with invalid inputs, which makes it the most suspicious due to the number of exception cases being handled."
