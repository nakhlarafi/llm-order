    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, the test case `testContainsNone_CharArrayWithBadSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion error, indicating that the expected result does not match the actual result. This suggests that there may be an issue with the `containsNone` method in the `StringUtils` class, particularly in how it handles supplementary characters.\n\nGiven that the test is specifically designed to check edge cases involving supplementary characters, the failure could indicate a bug or unexpected behavior in the `containsNone` method. Therefore, we can rank the methods based on their relevance to the failure and the potential for issues.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, there is only one method (`containsNone`) that is directly related to the test failure, making it the most suspicious. If there were more methods involved, they would be ranked accordingly based on their relevance to the failure."
