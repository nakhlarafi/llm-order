    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, the test case `testContainsNone_StringWithSupplementaryChars` has failed due to an assertion error, indicating that the method `StringUtils.containsNone` did not return the expected result. This suggests that there may be an issue with the implementation of the `containsNone` method or the way it handles supplementary characters.\n\nSince only one method is mentioned in the provided information, I will rank it as the most suspicious. Here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nIf there were more methods or additional context, I would rank them accordingly, but based on the current information, this is the only method to evaluate."
