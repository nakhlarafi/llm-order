    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, the test case `testContainsNone_StringWithBadSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion error, indicating that the expected result does not match the actual result. This suggests that there may be an issue with the implementation of the `containsNone` methods in the `StringUtils` class.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the context of the test failure:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 0** (`containsNone(Ljava/lang/CharSequence;Ljava/lang/String;)Z`): This method is most suspicious because it is directly involved in the test case that is failing. The test is asserting the behavior of this method when handling supplementary characters, which may not be correctly implemented.\n\n2. **Method ID 1** (`containsNone(Ljava/lang/CharSequence;[C)Z`): This method is also suspicious as it is called within the first method. If the first method is failing, it is likely that this method may also have issues, but it is less directly related to the test case than Method ID 0. \n\nBoth methods are related to the same functionality, but the first method is more directly implicated in the test failure."
