    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, the test method `testContainsNone_StringWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `true` but received `false`. This indicates a potential issue with the `containsNone` method in the `StringUtils` class. \n\nThe failure of the test suggests that the method may not be handling the input as expected, particularly with supplementary characters. Given that the test is specifically designed to check the behavior of the `containsNone` method with these characters, it raises suspicion about the implementation of that method.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the failure of the test and the context provided:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, only one method is identified as suspicious due to the direct correlation between the test failure and the method being tested. If there were more methods involved or additional context, the ranking could include more entries."
