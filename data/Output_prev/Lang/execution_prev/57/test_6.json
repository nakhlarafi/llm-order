This method is directly implicated in the stack trace and is likely the cause of the test failure. \n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, only one method is covered, which is `isAvailableLocale`, and it is ranked as the most suspicious due to the `NullPointerException` occurring in its execution."
