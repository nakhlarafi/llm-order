    "final_full_answer": "To determine the most suspicious methods based on the provided stack trace and the failing test, we need to analyze the methods involved in the stack trace and their relationships to the test case.\n\n1. **Method `inverseCumulativeProbability(double p)`** in `FDistributionImpl` (Method ID: 13) is directly involved in the test case and is the method that ultimately leads to the exception. This method is responsible for calculating the inverse cumulative probability, which is where the error occurs.\n\n2. **Method `inverseCumulativeProbability(double p)`** in `AbstractContinuousDistribution` (Method ID: 14) is also involved as it is called by the `FDistributionImpl` method. It handles the input and checks for valid ranges, which is critical in this context.\n\n3. **Method `bracket(UnivariateRealFunction, double, double, double)`** in `UnivariateRealSolverUtils` (Method ID: 15) is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of `AbstractContinuousDistribution`. The exception is thrown from this method, indicating that it is suspicious as well.\n\n4. **Method `bracket(UnivariateRealFunction, double, double, double)`** in `UnivariateRealSolverUtils` (Method ID: 20) is another overload of the bracket method that is also involved in the stack trace. It checks for valid parameters and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if they are invalid, which is the case here.\n\n5. **Method `getDomainLowerBound(double p)`** in `FDistributionImpl` (Method ID: 21) is called to determine the lower bound for the domain, which is relevant to the parameters being passed to the bracket method. If this method returns an incorrect value, it could lead to the exception.\n\nBased on this analysis, the ranking of the most suspicious methods is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
