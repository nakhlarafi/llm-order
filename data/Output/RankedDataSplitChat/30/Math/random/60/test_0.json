    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the method coverage information, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure of the test `testExtremeValues`. The failure is due to a `ConvergenceException` that occurs when evaluating a continued fraction, which suggests that the methods involved in the calculation of the cumulative probability for extreme values are the most suspicious.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.math.util.ContinuedFraction:evaluate(DDI)D`** - This method is directly involved in the evaluation of the continued fraction, which is where the exception occurs.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math.special.Gamma:regularizedGammaQ(DDDI)D`** - This method is called within the continued fraction evaluation and is likely contributing to the failure.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math.special.Erf:erf(D)D`** - This method is called by `cumulativeProbability`, and since it relies on the gamma functions, it is also suspicious.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(D)D`** - This method is the one being tested and is responsible for calling the other methods, making it a key player in the failure.\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl:<init>(DDD)V`** - The constructor initializes the distribution, and while it is less directly related to the failure, any issues with initialization could lead to problems in the methods that follow.\n\nHere is the JSON output for the ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
