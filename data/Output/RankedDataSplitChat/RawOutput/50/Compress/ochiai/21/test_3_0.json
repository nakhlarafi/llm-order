    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved and their potential contribution to the failure. The exception `java.io.IOException: Unknown property 128` indicates that the issue arises during the reading of file information, specifically in the `readFilesInfo` method of the `SevenZFile` class.\n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning for ranking the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n1. **Method ID 35**: `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz.SevenZFile:readFilesInfo(Ljava/io/DataInput;Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/sevenz/Archive;)V`\n   - This method is directly involved in reading file information and is where the exception is thrown. It is highly suspicious as it is the source of the error.\n\n2. **Method ID 34**: `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz.SevenZFile:readStreamsInfo(Ljava/io/DataInput;Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/sevenz/Archive;)V`\n   - This method is called before `readFilesInfo` and is responsible for reading stream information. If the stream information is incorrect, it could lead to issues in `readFilesInfo`.\n\n3. **Method ID 32**: `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz.SevenZFile:readSubStreamsInfo(Ljava/io/DataInput;Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/sevenz/Archive;)V`\n   - This method is also part of the reading process and could affect the data being processed in `readFilesInfo`.\n\n4. **Method ID 21**: `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz.SevenZOutputFile:writeFilesInfo(Ljava/io/DataOutput;)V`\n   - This method is responsible for writing file information. If the data written here is incorrect or not aligned with what is expected during reading, it could lead to the IOException.\n\n5. **Method ID 18**: `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz.SevenZOutputFile:writeHeader(Ljava/io/DataOutput;)V`\n   - This method writes the header information, which is crucial for the integrity of the file structure. If the header is malformed, it could lead to issues when reading the file.\n\nHere is the JSON output reflecting the rankings:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 32,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
