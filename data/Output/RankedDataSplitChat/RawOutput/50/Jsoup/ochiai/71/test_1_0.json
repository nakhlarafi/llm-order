    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved in the parsing process and their relevance to the failure. The failure occurs due to an unexpected token in the query parsing, which suggests that the methods responsible for parsing the selector are the most suspicious.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n1. **Method ID: 1** - `org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`\n   - This method is directly involved in parsing the HTML string and is the entry point for the parsing process.\n\n2. **Method ID: 0** - `org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`\n   - This method calls the parser method and is responsible for initiating the parsing process. It is also directly related to the test case.\n\n3. **Method ID: 2** - `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse(Ljava/io/Reader;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseSettings;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`\n   - This method is responsible for the actual parsing logic after the initial setup. It is crucial in the parsing flow.\n\n4. **Method ID: 3** - `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser()V`\n   - This method runs the parser and processes tokens. Since the error is related to token processing, this method is also suspicious.\n\n5. **Method ID: 11** - `org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)Z`\n   - This method processes tokens, which is directly related to the error encountered in the test. It is responsible for handling the tokens that lead to the parsing exception.\n\nHere is the JSON output for the ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
