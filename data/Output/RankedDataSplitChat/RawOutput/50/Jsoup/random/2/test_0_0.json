    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided test case and stack trace, we need to analyze the methods that are covered by the test and their relevance to the functionality being tested. The test case `handlesTextAfterData` is focused on parsing HTML and ensuring that the text after a `<script>` tag is handled correctly.\n\nHere are the methods that are most relevant to the parsing of HTML and handling of text nodes:\n\n1. **Method ID: 14** - `org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseTextNode()V`\n   - This method is directly responsible for parsing text nodes, which is crucial for the test case that checks how text is handled after a `<script>` tag.\n\n2. **Method ID: 3** - `org.jsoup.nodes.TextNode:getWholeText()Ljava/lang/String;`\n   - This method retrieves the whole text of a `TextNode`, which is essential for validating the output of the parsed document.\n\n3. **Method ID: 7** - `org.jsoup.parser.Parser:popStackToSuitableContainer(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Tag;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`\n   - This method is involved in managing the parsing stack and determining where elements can be added, which is relevant when handling nested tags like `<script>`.\n\n4. **Method ID: 22** - `org.jsoup.parser.Parser:popStackToClose(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Tag;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`\n   - This method is responsible for closing tags in the parsing process, which can affect how text is handled after certain tags.\n\n5. **Method ID: 39** - `org.jsoup.parser.Tag:canContain(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Tag;)Z`\n   - This method checks if a tag can contain another tag, which is relevant for understanding the structure of the parsed HTML and how text nodes are placed.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON output ranking the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 39,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
