    "final_full_answer": "Based on the additional coverage information provided, we can further analyze the methods involved in the `handlesCustomProtocols` test case. The focus remains on methods that deal with attributes, protocols, and the overall cleaning process. Here\u2019s the updated ranking of the top 10 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 107,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 138,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 106,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 90,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 51,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 50,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 86,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Updated Ranking:\n1. **Method ID 107 (`createSafeElement`)**: This method is crucial as it creates a safe element based on the whitelist, directly impacting the test's outcome.\n\n2. **Method ID 138 (`addProtocols`)**: This method adds protocols to the whitelist, which is essential for the test case that checks if specific protocols are preserved.\n\n3. **Method ID 106 (`clean`)**: The main method being tested, any issues here would directly affect the test results.\n\n4. **Method ID 90 (`addEnforcedAttribute`)**: This method adds enforced attributes to the whitelist, which is crucial for ensuring that the correct attributes are preserved during cleaning.\n\n5. **Method ID 51 (`currentElement`)**: This method retrieves the current element being processed, which is important for context when handling attributes and protocols.\n\n6. **Method ID 50 (`size`)**: This method checks the size of attributes, which could affect how many attributes are processed and whether any are missed.\n\n7. **Method ID 22 (`clean`)**: The main method being tested, any issues here would directly affect the test results.\n\n8. **Method ID 3 (`put`)**: Responsible for adding attributes to the `Attributes` object, any issues here could lead to incorrect attribute handling.\n\n9. **Method ID 1 (`runParser`)**: Part of the parsing process, which is essential for correctly interpreting the HTML input.\n\n10. **Method ID 86 (`basic`)**: This method initializes a basic whitelist, which is foundational for the cleaning process. If the whitelist is not set up correctly, it could lead to failures in the test.\n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' relevance to the functionality being tested and their potential impact on the outcome of the test case."
