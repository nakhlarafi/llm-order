    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved and rank them based on their relevance to the failure. The failure is due to a `NoSuchMethodError`, which indicates that the method being called does not exist in the expected form. This is likely related to the mocking and invocation of methods in the Mockito framework.\n\nHere are the top 5 most suspicious methods ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n1. **Method ID: 0** - `org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:callRealMethod()Ljava/lang/Object;`\n   - This method is directly involved in calling the real method on the mock, which is where the failure occurs.\n\n2. **Method ID: 45** - `org.mockito.internal.invocation.realmethod.FilteredCGLIBProxyRealMethod:invoke(Ljava/lang/Object;[Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;`\n   - This method is responsible for invoking the real method on the proxy, which is crucial in the context of the failure.\n\n3. **Method ID: 8** - `org.mockito.internal.creation.AbstractMockitoMethodProxy:invokeSuper(Ljava/lang/Object;[Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;`\n   - This method is part of the proxy mechanism and is involved in invoking the super method, which is relevant to the failure.\n\n4. **Method ID: 1** - `org.mockito.Mockito:withSettings()Lorg/mockito/MockSettings;`\n   - This method is related to the configuration of mocks, which could influence how methods are invoked and whether they exist.\n\n5. **Method ID: 2** - `org.mockito.Mockito:when(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lorg/mockito/stubbing/OngoingStubbing;`\n   - This method is used to set up the behavior of the mock, and any misconfiguration here could lead to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON output for the ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 45,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
