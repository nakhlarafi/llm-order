    "final_full_answer": "To determine the most suspicious methods based on the provided stack trace and test information, we need to analyze the context of the failure. The test `testOverrideGeoMeanWithMathClass` is failing because it expected a specific geometric mean value but received `NaN`. This suggests that there is an issue with the calculation of the geometric mean, likely related to the methods involved in computing it.\n\nHere are the methods that are most likely to be involved in this failure, ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n1. **Method ID 24**: `org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.GeometricMean:getResult()D`\n   - This method is directly responsible for returning the geometric mean. The failure indicates that it returned `NaN`, making it the most suspicious.\n\n2. **Method ID 5**: `org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.GeometricMean:evaluate([DII)D`\n   - This method is involved in the evaluation of the geometric mean. If it encounters invalid input or conditions, it could lead to a `NaN` result.\n\n3. **Method ID 8**: `org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.summary.SumOfLogs:increment(D)V`\n   - This method increments the sum of logs, which is crucial for calculating the geometric mean. If it does not handle values correctly, it could contribute to a `NaN` result.\n\n4. **Method ID 13**: `org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics:getGeometricMean()D`\n   - This method retrieves the geometric mean from the `geoMeanImpl`. If the underlying implementation is faulty, it could lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Method ID 1**: `org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics:setGeoMeanImpl(Lorg/apache/commons/math/stat/descriptive/StorelessUnivariateStatistic;)V`\n   - This method sets the implementation for calculating the geometric mean. If it is not set correctly or if the implementation is faulty, it could lead to issues in the calculation.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
