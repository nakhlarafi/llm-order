    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the method coverage information, we can analyze the methods involved in the failure of the test `testExtremeValues`. The failure is due to a `ConvergenceException` that occurs when evaluating a continued fraction, which suggests that the methods involved in the calculation of the cumulative probability for extreme values are the most suspicious.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.math.util.ContinuedFraction:evaluate(DDI)D`** - This method is directly involved in the evaluation of the continued fraction, which is where the exception is thrown.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math.special.Gamma:regularizedGammaQ(DDDI)D`** - This method is called within the continued fraction evaluation and is likely contributing to the failure.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math.special.Erf:erf(D)D`** - This method is used in the `cumulativeProbability` method and is part of the calculation that leads to the exception.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(D)D`** - This method is the one being tested and is responsible for calling the `Erf.erf` method, making it suspicious as well.\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl:<init>(DDD)V`** - The constructor initializes the distribution and could potentially lead to issues if the parameters are not set correctly, although it is less directly related to the exception.\n\nHere is the JSON output reflecting this ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
