    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information and stack trace, we can analyze the methods involved in the `handlesCustomProtocols` test case. The test is focused on validating the handling of custom protocols in HTML attributes, specifically for the `img` tag.\n\nThe most suspicious methods are those that are directly involved in the processing of protocols, attributes, and tags. Here\u2019s the ranking of the top 5 most suspicious methods:\n\n1. **Method ID: 0** - `org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:testValidProtocol(...)`\n   - This method is directly responsible for validating whether a protocol is valid for a given attribute. Since the test is checking for custom protocols, any issues here could lead to the test failing.\n\n2. **Method ID: 11** - `org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:addProtocols(...)`\n   - This method is responsible for adding protocols to the whitelist. If there is a problem with how protocols are added or stored, it could affect the test's outcome.\n\n3. **Method ID: 25** - `org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:isSafeTag(...)`\n   - This method checks if a tag is considered safe. If the `img` tag is not recognized as safe due to a failure in this method, it could lead to the test failing.\n\n4. **Method ID: 1** - `org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:basicWithImages()`\n   - This method initializes a whitelist that includes images. If this method does not correctly set up the whitelist, it could impact the test.\n\n5. **Method ID: 2** - `org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:basic()`\n   - This method creates a basic whitelist. While it is less directly related to the custom protocols, any issues in the foundational setup of the whitelist could lead to problems in the subsequent methods.\n\nHere is the JSON output for the ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
