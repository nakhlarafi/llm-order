    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided test case and stack trace, we need to analyze the methods that are covered by the test and their relevance to the functionality being tested. The test case `handlesTextAfterData` is focused on parsing HTML and ensuring that the text after a `<script>` tag is handled correctly.\n\nHere are the methods that are covered in the stack trace:\n\n1. **Selector Constructor** - This method initializes a Selector object, which is likely involved in selecting elements from the parsed document.\n2. **Attributes Constructor** - This method initializes an Attributes object, which is used to manage attributes of HTML elements.\n3. **Selector:select()** - This method is responsible for selecting elements based on a query, which is crucial for parsing and handling elements in the document.\n4. **Document:normalise()** - This method normalizes the document structure, which could be relevant when handling text nodes.\n5. **TextNode:getWholeText()** - This method retrieves the whole text of a TextNode, which is directly related to the test case that checks the text after a `<script>` tag.\n\nGiven the context of the test case, the methods that are most suspicious are those that directly deal with text handling and element selection. Here\u2019s the ranking based on their relevance to the test case:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Ranking:\n1. **TextNode:getWholeText() (ID 4)** - Most suspicious as it directly retrieves the text content, which is the focus of the test.\n2. **Document:normalise() (ID 3)** - Important for ensuring the document structure is correct, which affects how text is parsed.\n3. **Selector:select() (ID 2)** - Relevant for selecting elements, which is part of the parsing process.\n4. **Attributes Constructor (ID 1)** - While it initializes attributes, it is less directly related to the text handling in this context.\n5. **Selector Constructor (ID 0)** - Least suspicious as it is primarily about initializing the Selector and does not directly affect the parsing of text after a script tag."
