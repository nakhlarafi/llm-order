    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the methods covered in the test, we can analyze the potential causes of the failure. The test `CMAESOptimizerTest.testCigarWithBoundaries` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, which indicates that an assertion in the test did not hold true. This suggests that the methods involved in the optimization process, particularly those that compute values or perform operations on matrices, are likely candidates for the failure.\n\nHere are the top 5 most suspicious methods ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n1. **CMAESOptimizer:doOptimize()** - This method is central to the optimization process and is likely where the failure originates, as it handles the main logic of the optimization algorithm.\n2. **CMAESOptimizer:sqrt(RealMatrix)** - This method computes the square root of a matrix, which could lead to incorrect values if the matrix is not handled properly.\n3. **CMAESOptimizer:square(RealMatrix)** - Similar to the sqrt method, squaring a matrix could also lead to issues if the input matrix is not valid or if the operation is not implemented correctly.\n4. **CMAESOptimizer:randn1(int, int)** - This method generates random numbers, which could affect the optimization process if the generated values are not appropriate for the algorithm.\n5. **CMAESOptimizer:push(double[], double)** - This method modifies the fitness history, and if it does not handle the values correctly, it could lead to incorrect results in the optimization process.\n\nHere is the JSON output for the ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
