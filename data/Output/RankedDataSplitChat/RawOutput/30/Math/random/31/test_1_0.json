    "final_full_answer": "To determine the most suspicious methods based on the provided test failure and stack trace, we need to analyze the methods that are covered by the failing test. The test is specifically failing due to an issue with calculating the inverse cumulative probability, which suggests that methods related to this calculation are more likely to be the source of the problem.\n\nHere are the methods that are most relevant to the failure:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:inverseCumulativeProbability(D)D`** - This method is directly involved in the calculation that the test is failing on. It is highly suspicious because the test is explicitly checking the result of this method.\n\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:<init>(DDD)V`** - This constructor initializes the FDistribution object, which is necessary for the inverse cumulative probability calculation. If there is an issue with how the distribution is initialized, it could lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom()D`** - This method retrieves the denominator degrees of freedom, which is likely used in the calculations within the inverse cumulative probability method. If this value is incorrect, it could lead to inaccurate results.\n\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:getNumericalMean()D`** - This method calculates the numerical mean, which may also be used in the inverse cumulative probability calculation. If the mean is calculated incorrectly, it could affect the outcome.\n\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math3.special.Beta:regularizedBeta(DDD)D`** - This method is likely involved in the calculations related to the beta distribution, which is often used in statistical calculations involving F-distributions. If there is an issue with the regularized beta function, it could propagate to the inverse cumulative probability calculation.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the likelihood that issues in these methods could lead to the failure observed in the test."
