    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, we can analyze the stack trace and the methods covered by the test to determine which methods are most suspicious. The test is expecting a `SelectorParseException`, but instead, it encounters an `IllegalArgumentException` due to an empty string being passed to the `notEmpty` method.\n\nHere are the key points to consider:\n\n1. **`notEmpty(String string)`**: This method is directly involved in throwing the `IllegalArgumentException` when an empty string is passed. It is highly suspicious because it is the source of the unexpected exception.\n\n2. **`byAttribute()`**: This method is likely responsible for calling `notEmpty` with an empty string, which leads to the exception. It is suspicious because it is part of the parsing logic that handles attributes.\n\n3. **`contains(boolean own)`**: This method calls `notEmpty` with the search text. If the search text is empty, it will trigger the `IllegalArgumentException`. It is suspicious as it is part of the logic that processes the `:contains` selector.\n\n4. **`findElements()`**: This method is responsible for determining which elements to find based on the query. It may call `byAttribute()` or other methods that could lead to the empty string being passed to `notEmpty`.\n\n5. **`parse(String query)`**: This method initializes the parsing process. If the input query is malformed (as it appears to be in the test), it could lead to the chain of calls that results in the empty string being passed to `notEmpty`.\n\nBased on this analysis, here are the top 5 most suspicious methods ranked:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n- **Method ID 1** (`notEmpty(String string)`) is ranked highest because it directly throws the exception.\n- **Method ID 10** (`contains(boolean own)`) is next as it calls `notEmpty` with the search text.\n- **Method ID 8** (`findElements()`) is involved in the logic that could lead to an empty string being passed.\n- **Method ID 6** (`parse(String query)`) initializes the parsing process and is responsible for the input query.\n- **Method ID 7** (`parse()`) is also part of the parsing logic and could contribute to the issue."
