    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we need to analyze the methods involved in the stack trace and their relevance to the failure.\n\n1. **Most Suspicious**: The method `inverseCumulativeProbability` in `NormalDistributionImpl` is directly involved in the test that failed. The stack trace indicates that this method is where the exception originated, making it the most suspicious.\n\n2. **Second Most Suspicious**: The method `inverseCumulativeProbability` in `AbstractContinuousDistribution` is also directly related to the failure since it is called by the `NormalDistributionImpl` method. It handles the logic for the inverse cumulative probability, which is central to the test.\n\n3. **Third Most Suspicious**: The method `bracket` in `UnivariateRealSolverUtils` is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method. The failure is related to convergence issues, which suggests that this method's logic for finding a root may be flawed or not handling certain cases correctly.\n\n4. **Fourth Most Suspicious**: The constructor `NormalDistributionImpl` is responsible for initializing the distribution parameters. If the parameters (mean and standard deviation) are not set correctly, it could lead to issues in the calculations performed in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method.\n\n5. **Fifth Most Suspicious**: The method `setStandardDeviation` in `NormalDistributionImpl` is relevant because it sets the standard deviation, which is critical for the calculations in the distribution methods. If this method has a bug or is called incorrectly, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON output ranking the methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
