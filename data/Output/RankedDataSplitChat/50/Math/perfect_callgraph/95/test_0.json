    "final_full_answer": "To determine the most suspicious methods based on the provided stack trace and the failing test, we need to analyze the methods involved in the stack trace and their relationships to the test case.\n\n1. **Method `inverseCumulativeProbability(double p)`** in `FDistributionImpl` (Method ID: 13) is directly involved in the test case and is the method that ultimately leads to the exception. This method is responsible for calculating the inverse cumulative probability, which is where the error occurs.\n\n2. **Method `inverseCumulativeProbability(double p)`** in `AbstractContinuousDistribution` (Method ID: 14) is also involved as it is called by the `FDistributionImpl` method. It handles the input and checks for valid ranges, which is crucial in this context.\n\n3. **Method `bracket(UnivariateRealFunction, double, double, double)`** in `UnivariateRealSolverUtils` (Method ID: 15) is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of `AbstractContinuousDistribution`. The exception is thrown from this method, indicating that it is suspicious as it deals with the bounds for the root-finding function.\n\n4. **Method `getDomainLowerBound(double p)`** in `FDistributionImpl` (Method ID: 21) is called to determine the lower bound for the probability, which is critical for the calculations in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method.\n\n5. **Method `getDomainUpperBound(double p)`** in `FDistributionImpl` (Method ID: 18) is also relevant as it provides the upper bound for the probability, which is necessary for the bracket method.\n\nBased on this analysis, the ranking of the most suspicious methods is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
