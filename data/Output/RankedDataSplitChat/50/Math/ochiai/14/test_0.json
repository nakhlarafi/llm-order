    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved and rank them in terms of suspicion regarding the `OutOfMemoryError`. The error indicates that the application ran out of heap space, which is often caused by excessive memory allocation, particularly in data structures like matrices.\n\nHere are the top 5 most suspicious methods ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.math3.linear.BlockRealMatrix:createBlocksLayout(II)[[D`** (Method ID: 24)\n   - This method is responsible for creating a layout for blocks in a matrix, which can lead to significant memory usage if the dimensions are large.\n\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math3.linear.BlockRealMatrix:<init>(II)V`** (Method ID: 23)\n   - The constructor for `BlockRealMatrix` initializes a matrix with specified dimensions, which can consume a lot of memory, especially if the dimensions are large.\n\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math3.linear.MatrixUtils:createRealMatrix(II)Lorg/apache/commons/math3/linear/RealMatrix;`** (Method ID: 28)\n   - This method creates a real matrix and can also lead to high memory consumption if the size of the matrix is large.\n\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math3.fitting.CurveFitter:fit(ILorg/apache/commons/math3/analysis/ParametricUnivariateFunction;[D)[D`** (Method ID: 2)\n   - This method is involved in fitting a curve and may allocate memory for observations, which could contribute to memory issues if the number of observations is large.\n\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math3.fitting.CurveFitter:addObservedPoint(DDD)V`** (Method ID: 7)\n   - This method adds observed points to the fitter, which can increase memory usage as more points are added, especially in a loop with a large number of iterations.\n\nHere is the JSON output for the ranked methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
