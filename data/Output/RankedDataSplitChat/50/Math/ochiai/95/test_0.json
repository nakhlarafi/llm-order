    "final_full_answer": "To determine the most suspicious methods based on the provided stack trace and the failing test, we need to analyze the methods involved in the stack trace and their relationships to the error that occurred.\n\nThe error message indicates an `IllegalArgumentException` due to invalid endpoint parameters in the `bracket` method of `UnivariateRealSolverUtils`. This suggests that the parameters being passed to this method are not valid, which could be due to issues in the methods that compute the bounds or the initial domain.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the methods involved:\n\n1. **`inverseCumulativeProbability(double p)`** (Method ID: 3) - This method is directly involved in the computation that leads to the error. It calls the `bracket` method, which is where the exception is thrown.\n\n2. **`getDomainLowerBound(double p)`** (Method ID: 0) - This method returns a lower bound of 0.0, which is used in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method. If the initial value is less than this, it could lead to an invalid state.\n\n3. **`getDomainUpperBound(double p)`** (Method ID: 1) - This method returns `Double.MAX_VALUE`, which is also used in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method. If the upper bound is not set correctly, it could lead to issues.\n\n4. **`getInitialDomain(double p)`** (Method ID: 2) - This method calculates the initial domain based on the degrees of freedom. If this calculation is incorrect, it could lead to invalid parameters being passed to the `bracket` method.\n\n5. **`setNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom(double degreesOfFreedom)`** (Method ID: 8) - This method sets the numerator degrees of freedom. If it allows invalid values (e.g., negative or zero), it could lead to issues in the calculations.\n\nBased on this analysis, the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the likelihood that issues in these methods contributed to the failure of the test."
