Since there are no other methods covered in the test, we can only rank this method. \n\nGiven that the test is failing, we can assume that the method `stripLeadingHyphens` is the most suspicious, as it is directly related to the test case that is failing. \n\nHere is the JSON output ranking the method:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nSince there are no other methods to compare against, this is the only entry in the ranking."
