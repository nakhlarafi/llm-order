    "final_full_answer": "To determine the most suspicious methods based on the provided test and coverage information, we need to analyze the methods that are directly involved in the functionality being tested. The test is focused on the `normalizedStandard` method of the `Period` class, which is expected to normalize a period based on the specified `PeriodType`.\n\nThe following methods are particularly relevant to the test:\n\n1. **`normalizedStandard(PeriodType)`** - This is the method being tested directly.\n2. **`getYears()`, `getMonths()`, `getDays()`, `getHours()`, `getMinutes()`, `getSeconds()`, `getMillis()`** - These methods are used to retrieve the respective values from the `Period` object.\n3. **`withYears(int)` and `withMonths(int)`** - These methods are used to modify the `Period` object.\n4. **`checkAndUpdate(DurationFieldType, int[], int)`** - This method is used internally to validate and update the period values.\n5. **`setPeriodInternal(...)`** - This method is responsible for setting the internal values of the period.\n6. **`getPeriodType()`** - This method retrieves the `PeriodType`, which is crucial for the normalization process.\n7. **`getIndexedField(ReadablePeriod, int)`** - This method is used to get the indexed field value based on the `PeriodType`.\n8. **`checkPeriodType(PeriodType)`** - This method checks the validity of the `PeriodType`.\n9. **`indexOf(DurationFieldType)`** - This method is used to find the index of a specific duration field type.\n10. **`size()`** - This method returns the size of the period, which may be relevant in certain calculations.\n\nBased on this analysis, the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be involved in the failure of the test, with the `normalizedStandard` method being the most suspicious since it is the primary focus of the test."
