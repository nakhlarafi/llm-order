The ranking is based on the likelihood that a failure in the test could be traced back to issues in the implementation of these methods.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 92,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 75,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 93,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be involved in the failure of the test based on their roles in handling mock interactions and reporting issues related to them."
