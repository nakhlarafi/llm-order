The methods that are directly involved in the mocking and handling of generics are prioritized, as they are likely to be the source of the failure in the test.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 142,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 143,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 141,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 92,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be involved in the failure of the test, particularly those that deal with the return types and generics, as well as the core mocking functionality."
