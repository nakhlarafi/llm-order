The methods that are directly related to the mocking and spying functionality are considered more suspicious due to their involvement in the test that is failing.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 54,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 158,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 48,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 242,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 77,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 110,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking is based on the methods' relevance to the mocking and spying process, particularly in the context of the test that is failing. Methods that handle the creation and management of mocks and spies are prioritized."
