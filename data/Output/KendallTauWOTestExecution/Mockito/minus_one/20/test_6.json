The ranking is based on their relevance to the failure of the test, which is related to the inability to create a mock instance due to a throwing constructor.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 94,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 80,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 37,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 112,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 94**: This method is directly related to creating a new spy instance, which is crucial in the context of the test that fails due to a throwing constructor.\n2. **Method ID 80**: This method is responsible for creating a mock based on the settings, which is also relevant to the failure.\n3. **Method ID 37**: This method validates constructor use, which is directly related to the issue of a throwing constructor.\n4. **Method ID 112**: This method processes the `@Spy` annotation, which is central to the test case.\n5. **Method ID 2**: This method creates registered invocations, which could be involved in the mocking process.\n6. **Method ID 1**: This method validates the state of mocking, which could be relevant if the mocking process is not set up correctly.\n7. **Method ID 4**: This method checks if an object is a Mockito mock, which is relevant to the test's context.\n8. **Method ID 10**: This method retrieves a mock instance, which is relevant to the failure.\n9. **Method ID 12**: This method processes independent annotations, which could affect the mocking process.\n10. **Method ID 13**: This method is related to the creation of mock keys, which could be involved in the mocking process. \n\nThe ranking reflects the methods' direct involvement in the mocking process and their potential to cause the specific failure observed in the test."
