The ranking is based on their relevance to the test case, which is focused on handling exceptions thrown by constructors during instantiation.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 112,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 190,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 188,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 45,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 140,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 141,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 47,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 112**: This method is directly involved in the instantiation process and is likely to throw exceptions if the constructor fails.\n2. **Method ID 190**: This method is part of the constructor instantiation logic, making it critical in the context of the test.\n3. **Method ID 188**: This method is responsible for finding the largest constructor, which is relevant when dealing with constructors that may throw exceptions.\n4. **Method ID 45**: This method checks if the constructor is being used, which is relevant to the test's focus on constructor exceptions.\n5. **Method ID 140**: This method validates the use of constructors, which is directly related to the test's purpose.\n6. **Method ID 141**: This method creates mocks, which may involve constructor calls that could throw exceptions.\n7. **Method ID 47**: This method validates settings, which may include constructor-related settings.\n8. **Method ID 4**: This method retrieves default answers, which could be relevant in the context of mocking behavior.\n9. **Method ID 0**: This method checks if a constructor is being used, which is relevant to the test.\n10. **Method ID 1**: This method scans for deprecated annotations, which may not be directly related but could still be involved in the overall instantiation process."
