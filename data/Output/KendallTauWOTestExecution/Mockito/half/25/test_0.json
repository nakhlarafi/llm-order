The methods that are directly involved in the mocking and handling of generics are considered more suspicious due to their relevance to the failing test.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 50,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 48,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 76,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 45,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 88,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking prioritizes methods that are involved in the creation and handling of mocks, especially those related to generics and type variables, as they are most likely to be the source of issues in the context of the provided test."
