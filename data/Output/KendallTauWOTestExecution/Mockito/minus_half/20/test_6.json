The ranking is based on their relevance to the failure of the test, particularly focusing on the handling of the `@Spy` annotation and constructor issues.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 58,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 93,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 54,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 140,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 95,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 14**: This method is responsible for creating a new spy instance, which is directly related to the failure of the test when trying to initialize a spy with a constructor that is not accessible.\n2. **Method ID 58**: This method handles the spy annotation, which is crucial for the test that fails due to the inability to create a mock instance.\n3. **Method ID 6**: This method is involved in injecting mocks on fields, which is relevant to the test's context.\n4. **Method ID 5**: This method is responsible for the injection of mocks on fields, which is also relevant to the test.\n5. **Method ID 15**: This method validates the type of the mock, which could be related to the failure if the type is not mockable.\n6. **Method ID 93**: This method validates if the mocked type is serializable, which could indirectly affect the creation of mocks.\n7. **Method ID 54**: This method validates constructor use, which is directly related to the test's failure when a constructor is not accessible.\n8. **Method ID 60**: This method checks for incompatible annotations, which could be relevant if the spy is not set up correctly.\n9. **Method ID 140**: This method processes the spy annotation, which is directly related to the test's context.\n10. **Method ID 95**: This method initializes mocks, which is the starting point of the test and could lead to the failure if not handled correctly."
