The methods that are directly involved in the stubbing and verification processes are more likely to be the cause of the failure, especially those related to the `stubVoid` and `toThrow` functionalities, as well as the verification methods.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 46,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 117,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 171,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 171,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking is based on the methods' involvement in the stubbing and verification processes, which are critical to the test's success. Methods that handle exceptions and stubbing are prioritized as they are more likely to be the source of the failure."
