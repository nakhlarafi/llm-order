    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test and the methods covered, we can analyze the methods for potential issues that could lead to the test failure. The test checks that the sum of squared errors is non-negative, which directly involves the calculations in the `addData` and `getSumSquaredErrors` methods. \n\n1. **addData(double x, double y)**: This method is responsible for updating the internal state of the regression model with new data points. If there is an issue in how it calculates the sums or updates the averages, it could lead to incorrect results in `getSumSquaredErrors()`. This method is the most suspicious.\n\n2. **getSumSquaredErrors()**: This method computes the sum of squared errors based on the internal state maintained by `addData`. If `addData` has a bug, it will directly affect the output of this method. Therefore, it is the second most suspicious.\n\n3. **<init>()**: The constructor initializes the `SimpleRegression` object. While it is less likely to be the source of the problem, if it fails to initialize any of the internal state variables correctly, it could lead to issues later on. However, since it does not perform any calculations, it is the least suspicious of the three.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nSince there are only three methods covered, the ranking stops here. If there were more methods, we would continue ranking them accordingly."
