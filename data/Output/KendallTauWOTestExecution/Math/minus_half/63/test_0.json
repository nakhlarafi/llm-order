    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test coverage information, we can analyze the methods involved in the `MathUtils.equals` functionality. The test cases cover various scenarios, including comparisons of arrays with null values, empty arrays, and arrays containing special floating-point values like `NaN` and `Infinity`.\n\n### Analysis of Methods:\n1. **Method ID 1 (`equals(double[] x, double[] y)`)**: This method is the primary method being tested. It handles the comparison of two arrays of doubles, including null checks and length checks. Given that the test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, this method is highly suspicious as it is directly involved in the failing test cases.\n\n2. **Method ID 0 (`equals(double x, double y)`)**: This method is called within the array comparison method to compare individual double values. It handles the comparison of two doubles, including the special case for `NaN`. Since the test cases also include comparisons of `NaN` values, this method is also suspicious, but to a lesser extent than the array comparison method.\n\n### Ranking:\n1. Method ID 1 (equals(double[] x, double[] y)) - Most suspicious due to direct involvement in multiple test cases.\n2. Method ID 0 (equals(double x, double y)) - Less suspicious but still relevant due to its role in comparing individual double values.\n\nSince there are only two methods covered in the test, we will rank them accordingly. The output will reflect the two methods in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
