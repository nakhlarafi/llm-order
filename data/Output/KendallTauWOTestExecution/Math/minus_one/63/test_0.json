    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test coverage information, we can analyze the methods involved in the `MathUtils.equals` functionality. The test cases cover various scenarios, including comparisons of arrays with null values, empty arrays, and arrays containing special floating-point values like `NaN` and `Infinity`. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 0**: `MathUtils.equals(double[] x, double[] y)` - This method is responsible for comparing two arrays of doubles. It handles null checks, length checks, and element-wise comparisons. Given that the test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, this method is highly suspicious as it is directly tested and has multiple edge cases.\n\n2. **Method ID 1**: `MathUtils.equals(double x, double y)` - This method compares two double values, including special cases for `NaN`. While it is also tested, it is less suspicious than the array comparison method because it is a simpler comparison and is only called within the context of the array comparison method.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious. Since there are only two methods covered, we will rank them accordingly.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
