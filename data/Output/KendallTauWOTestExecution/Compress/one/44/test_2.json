The test is designed to check if a `NullPointerException` is thrown when the constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream` is called with a null parameter. Since the constructor is the only method involved, it is the most suspicious.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
