The methods that are directly involved in the failure of the test (i.e., those that are expected to throw an exception when `finish()` is called after `putArchiveEntry()`) are ranked higher.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 101,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 78,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 47,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 81,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 108,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 25** (`ZipArchiveOutputStream.finish()`): This method is directly involved in the test failure as it is expected to throw an exception if there are unclosed entries.\n2. **Method ID 0** (`TarArchiveOutputStream.finish()`): Similar to the above, this method is also expected to throw an exception under the same conditions.\n3. **Method ID 101** (`CpioArchiveOutputStream.finish()`): This method is also expected to throw an exception if there are unclosed entries.\n4. **Method ID 20** (`JarArchiveOutputStream.putArchiveEntry()`): This method is involved in adding entries and is relevant to the context of the test.\n5. **Method ID 78** (`CpioArchiveOutputStream.putArchiveEntry()`): Similar to the above, this method is involved in adding entries.\n6. **Method ID 47** (`TarArchiveOutputStream.putArchiveEntry()`): This method is also involved in adding entries.\n7. **Method ID 81** (`ZipArchiveOutputStream.putArchiveEntry()`): This method is involved in adding entries and is relevant to the context of the test.\n8. **Method ID 108** (`ArArchiveOutputStream.finish()`): This method is also expected to throw an exception if there are unclosed entries.\n9. **Method ID 1** (`ArchiveStreamFactory.createArchiveOutputStream()`): This method is responsible for creating the archive output stream and is relevant to the context of the test.\n10. **Method ID 9** (`CpioArchiveOutputStream.ensureOpen()`): This method checks if the stream is open and is relevant to the context of the test."
