    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test and the methods covered, the following ranking of methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is generated. The methods are ranked based on their relevance to the test case, which focuses on normalizing invisible characters in text and ensuring the correct output of HTML and text content.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 202,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 107,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 202**: The `text()` method is directly responsible for returning the normalized text, making it the most suspicious.\n2. **Method ID 107**: The `appendNormalisedText()` method is crucial for appending normalized text, which is directly related to the test's focus on text normalization.\n3. **Method ID 0**: The `tail()` method in the `NodeVisitor` is part of the traversal logic that could affect how text is accumulated.\n4. **Method ID 1**: The `matches()` method in the `Evaluator` class is relevant for matching elements, which could impact the selection of elements in the test.\n5. **Method ID 3**: The `traverse()` method is responsible for traversing nodes, which is essential for the text normalization process.\n6. **Method ID 4**: The `tail()` method in the `Collector` class is part of the node collection process, which could influence the final output.\n7. **Method ID 5**: The `head()` method in the `Collector` class is also part of the node collection process, making it relevant.\n8. **Method ID 6**: The `Accumulator` constructor is involved in the collection of elements, which is indirectly related to the test.\n9. **Method ID 8**: The `collect()` method is responsible for collecting elements based on the evaluator, which is relevant to the test.\n10. **Method ID 11**: The `select()` method is responsible for selecting elements based on the evaluator, making it relevant but less suspicious than the others."
