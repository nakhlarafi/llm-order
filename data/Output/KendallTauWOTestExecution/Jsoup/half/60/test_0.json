    "final_full_answer": "To determine the most suspicious methods based on the provided test and coverage information, we need to analyze the methods that are directly involved in the parsing process, especially those that handle the `:contains` selector, as this is the focus of the failing test.\n\n1. **Method `contains(boolean own)` (ID: 25)**: This method is directly responsible for handling the `:contains` selector. It calls `Validate.notEmpty` to ensure that the search text is not empty, which is crucial for the test case that expects a `SelectorParseException`.\n\n2. **Method `parse()` (ID: 1)**: This method orchestrates the parsing process and is responsible for calling `findElements()`, which includes the logic for handling various selectors, including `:contains`.\n\n3. **Method `findElements()` (ID: 24)**: This method is responsible for identifying the correct evaluator based on the selector syntax. It includes a call to `contains(false)` when it encounters the `:contains` selector.\n\n4. **Method `byTag()` (ID: 0)**: This method is involved in processing tag selectors. While it may not be directly related to the `:contains` selector, it is part of the overall parsing logic.\n\n5. **Method `consumeElementSelector()` (ID: 22)**: This method consumes the element selector from the token queue, which is essential for parsing any selector, including `:contains`.\n\n6. **Method `notEmpty(String string)` (ID: 2)**: This method is called within `contains(boolean own)` to validate that the search text is not empty. If the input is invalid, it throws an exception, which is relevant to the test case.\n\n7. **Method `matchesAny(String... seq)` (ID: 19)**: This method checks if the token queue matches any of the provided sequences. It is used in various parts of the parsing logic, including in `findElements()`.\n\n8. **Method `consumeWhitespace()` (ID: 6)**: This method is responsible for consuming whitespace in the token queue, which is a fundamental part of parsing any selector.\n\n9. **Method `matchesWord()` (ID: 10)**: This method checks if the current position in the token queue matches a word character. It is used in the parsing logic and could affect how selectors are interpreted.\n\n10. **Method `matchChomp(String seq)` (ID: 13)**: This method checks if the token queue matches a specific sequence and consumes it if it does. It is part of the parsing logic and could impact the handling of selectors.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
