Since there are no other methods mentioned in the coverage information, we can only rank this method.\n\nGiven that the test is failing, it indicates that the method `isAvailableLocale` is likely the source of the issue. Therefore, it should be ranked as the most suspicious method.\n\nHere is the JSON output reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
