Since there is only one method covered by the test, we can infer that this method is the most suspicious due to the lack of additional context or coverage from other methods.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nIn this case, `isAvailableLocale` is the only method covered, making it the most suspicious by default. There are no other methods to compare against, so it ranks first."
