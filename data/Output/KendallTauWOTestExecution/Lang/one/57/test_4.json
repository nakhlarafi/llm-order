Since there are no other methods mentioned in the coverage information, we can only rank this method.\n\nGiven that the test is failing, we can infer that the method `isAvailableLocale` is the most suspicious, as it is directly involved in the assertions being tested. There are no other methods to compare against, so it will be ranked as the most suspicious.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
