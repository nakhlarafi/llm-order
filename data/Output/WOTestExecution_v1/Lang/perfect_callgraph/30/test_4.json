The test is specifically checking the behavior of the `containsNone` method when dealing with supplementary characters, which may indicate potential issues with character handling.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, there is only one method covered by the test, which is `StringUtils.containsNone`. Since the test is failing, it indicates that this method is likely the source of the issue, making it the most suspicious. There are no other methods provided in the coverage information to rank against."
