The ranking is based on their relevance to the test case that is failing, which involves mocking an abstract class and using a constructor.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 38,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 89,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 120,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 75,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 4**: `callRealMethod()` - This method is directly related to calling real methods on mocks, which is crucial when dealing with abstract classes.\n2. **Method ID 5**: `isInvokable()` - This method checks if a super method can be invoked, which is relevant when dealing with abstract classes.\n3. **Method ID 38**: `validateConstructorUse()` - This method validates the use of constructors, which is directly relevant to the test case.\n4. **Method ID 89**: `isUsingConstructor()` - This method checks if the constructor is being used, which is essential for the test.\n5. **Method ID 120**: `useConstructor()` - This method sets the use of the constructor, making it relevant to the test.\n6. **Method ID 75**: `answer()` - This method handles the answer for the invocation, which is relevant when dealing with mocks.\n7. **Method ID 1**: `mock()` - This method is responsible for creating mocks, which is fundamental to the test.\n8. **Method ID 0**: `getMethod()` - This method retrieves the method being mocked, which is relevant but less so than others.\n9. **Method ID 14**: `scanDeprecatedWay()` - This method processes annotations, which may indirectly affect the test.\n10. **Method ID 2**: `createRegisteredInvocations()` - This method creates registered invocations, which is relevant but less directly related to the test case."
