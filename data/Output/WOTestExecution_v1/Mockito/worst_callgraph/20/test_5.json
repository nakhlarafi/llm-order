The ranking is based on their relevance to the failure of the test, which is related to mocking inner classes with the wrong outer instance.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 42,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 64,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 86,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 102,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 104,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 42**: Directly related to setting the outer instance, which is crucial for the test case.\n2. **Method ID 64**: Checks if the constructor is being used, which is relevant to the mocking process.\n3. **Method ID 86**: Indicates the use of constructor in mock settings, which is directly related to the test.\n4. **Method ID 102**: Involves the confirmation of mock settings, which includes outer instance settings.\n5. **Method ID 0**: The main mock method that is being tested, hence it is suspicious.\n6. **Method ID 12**: Initializes mocks, which is part of the mocking process.\n7. **Method ID 21**: Related to constructor injection, which is relevant to the test case.\n8. **Method ID 23**: Validates constructor use, which is directly related to the test failure.\n9. **Method ID 60**: Involves creating mocks, which is part of the mocking process.\n10. **Method ID 104**: Related to creating mocks with specific settings, which is relevant to the test case."
