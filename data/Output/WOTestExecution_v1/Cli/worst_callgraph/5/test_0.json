    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, we have a failing test for the method `stripLeadingHyphens` in the `Util` class. The test checks various scenarios for stripping leading hyphens from a string. Since the test is failing, it indicates that there might be an issue with the implementation of the `stripLeadingHyphens` method.\n\nTo rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious, we will consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Directly Covered Method**: The method directly covered by the failing test is the most suspicious since the test is designed to validate its behavior.\n2. **Related Methods**: Any methods that are called within `stripLeadingHyphens` or are closely related to its functionality may also be considered suspicious.\n3. **Complexity and Edge Cases**: Methods that handle string manipulation or have edge cases similar to those tested may also be ranked higher.\n\nGiven that we only have one method directly covered by the test, we will rank it as the most suspicious. Since there are no other methods provided in the context, we will only include the one method.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
