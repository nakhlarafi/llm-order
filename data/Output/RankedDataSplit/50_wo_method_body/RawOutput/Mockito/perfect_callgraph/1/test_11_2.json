    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the methods that are involved in the failure of the test. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method, which is called by `InvocationMarker.markVerified`, and subsequently by `NumberOfInvocationsChecker.check`.\n\nGiven this context, we can update the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the failure:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom** - This method is directly involved in the failure, as it throws the `UnsupportedOperationException`. It should be ranked highest.\n2. **InvocationMarker.markVerified** - This method is also directly involved in the failure, as it calls `captureArgumentsFrom`.\n3. **NumberOfInvocationsChecker.check** - This method is involved in the verification process and is part of the stack trace leading to the failure.\n4. **Times.verify** - This method is responsible for verifying the number of invocations and is part of the verification process.\n5. **VerificationModeFactory.times** - This method creates a verification mode for the number of invocations, which is relevant to the test.\n6. **Times.<init>** - The constructor for the Times class is relevant as it sets up the verification mode.\n7. **InvocationNotifierHandler.notifyMethodCallException** - This method is involved in handling exceptions during method calls, which could be relevant in the context of the failure.\n8. **InvocationNotifierHandler.notifyMethodCall** - Similar to the above, this method handles notifications for method calls.\n9. **MockHandlerImpl.handle** - This method is responsible for handling invocations and could be relevant in the context of the failure.\n10. **MockUtil.isMock** - This method checks if an object is a mock, which is a fundamental part of Mockito's functionality.\n\nNow, let's represent this updated ranking in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 120,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 85,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 57,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 131,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 50,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 115,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 135,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' involvement in the failure based on the new coverage information and stack trace analysis."
