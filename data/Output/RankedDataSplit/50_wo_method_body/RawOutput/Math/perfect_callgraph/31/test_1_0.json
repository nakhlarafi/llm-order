    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, the following methods are ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious. The ranking is based on their involvement in the failing test and the stack trace, particularly focusing on methods that are directly related to the calculation of the inverse cumulative probability, as well as those that are part of the `FDistribution` class and its dependencies.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 19**: `inverseCumulativeProbability` is directly involved in the failing test, making it the most suspicious.\n2. **Method ID 26**: `cumulativeProbability` is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability`, making it highly relevant.\n3. **Method ID 17**: `calculateNumericalVariance` is related to variance calculations, which can affect probability distributions.\n4. **Method ID 1**: The constructor of `FDistribution` initializes the distribution parameters, which could lead to issues if not set correctly.\n5. **Method ID 0**: Another constructor for `FDistribution`, also critical for initialization.\n6. **Method ID 21**: Retrieves the denominator degrees of freedom, which is essential for the distribution calculations.\n7. **Method ID 30**: Retrieves the numerator degrees of freedom, also essential for calculations.\n8. **Method ID 7**: `getNumericalVariance` is involved in variance calculations, which can impact the results.\n9. **Method ID 4**: `getSupportUpperBound` is relevant for understanding the limits of the distribution.\n10. **Method ID 3**: The `NoBracketingException` constructor is less directly related but still part of the error handling in the context of solving equations related to the distribution."
