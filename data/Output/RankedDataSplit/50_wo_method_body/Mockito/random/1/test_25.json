    "final_full_answer": "Based on the new coverage information and the stack trace provided, we can analyze the situation further. The test `shouldRemoveAllStubbing` is failing due to an `UnsupportedOperationException` that occurs in the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method. This indicates that the issue may be related to how arguments are being captured or handled during the stubbing process.\n\nGiven that the stack trace points to `InvocationMatcher` and `InvocationNotifierHandler`, we should consider adjusting the rankings of the methods that are involved in this process. The methods that are most relevant to the failure are likely to be those that deal with invocation handling and argument capturing.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking based on the new information:\n\n1. **Rank: 1**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.handler.InvocationNotifierHandler:notifyMethodCall(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;Ljava/lang/Object;)V`\n   - Method ID: 22\n   - **Reason**: This method is directly involved in handling method calls and is part of the stack trace.\n\n2. **Rank: 2**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.verification.DefaultRegisteredInvocations:add(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)V`\n   - Method ID: 48\n   - **Reason**: This method is related to the registration of invocations, which is crucial for stubbing and verification.\n\n3. **Rank: 3**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.progress.MockingProgressImpl:validateState()V`\n   - Method ID: 5\n   - **Reason**: This method validates the state of mocking, which could be relevant when resetting mocks.\n\n4. **Rank: 4**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.OngoingStubbingImpl:thenAnswer(Lorg/mockito/stubbing/Answer;)Lorg/mockito/stubbing/OngoingStubbing;`\n   - Method ID: 41\n   - **Reason**: This method is involved in defining behavior for stubbings, which is relevant to the test.\n\n5. **Rank: 5**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.AnswersValidator:validateDefaultAnswerReturnedValue(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;Ljava/lang/Object;)V`\n   - Method ID: 6\n   - **Reason**: This method validates the returned values from stubbings, which could be related to the issue.\n\n6. **Rank: 6**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.MockInjection$OngoingMockInjection:tryConstructorInjection()Lorg/mockito/internal/configuration/injection/MockInjection$OngoingMockInjection;`\n   - Method ID: 114\n   - **Reason**: This method is less directly related but still part of the mock creation process.\n\n7. **Rank: 7**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.util.MockCreationValidator:validateMockedType(Ljava/lang/Class;Ljava/lang/Object;)V`\n   - Method ID: 4\n   - **Reason**: This method validates the types being mocked, which is a foundational aspect of mocking.\n\n8. **Rank: 8**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultAnnotationEngine:createMockFor(Ljava/lang/annotation/Annotation;Ljava/lang/reflect/Field;)Ljava/lang/Object;`\n   - Method ID: 1\n   - **Reason**: This method is related to creating mocks based on annotations.\n\n9. **Rank: 9**\n   - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.StubbedInvocationMatcher:<init>(Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/InvocationMatcher;Lorg/mockito/stubbing/Answer;)V`\n   - Method ID: 166\n   - **Reason**: This method is related to the initialization of stubbed invocations.\n\n10. **Rank: 10**\n    - Method Signature: `org.mockito.internal.creation.settings.CreationSettings:setExtraInterfaces(Ljava/util/Set;)Lorg/mockito/internal/creation/settings/CreationSettings;`\n    - Method ID: 180\n    - **Reason**: This method is less relevant to the current issue but still part of the mock creation settings.\n\nHere is the final ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 48,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 114,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 166,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 180,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
