    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test information, stack trace, and method coverage, we can analyze the methods involved in the `Fraction` class to determine their suspiciousness. The test is failing due to an assertion that compares expected and actual values, which indicates that the method responsible for producing the output is likely the source of the issue.\n\nHere\u2019s the analysis of the methods:\n\n1. **getReducedFraction(int numerator, int denominator)**: This method is directly involved in the test and is responsible for reducing the fraction. The failure in the test indicates that this method is likely the most suspicious, as it is where the expected and actual values diverge.\n\n2. **greatestCommonDivisor(int u, int v)**: This method is called within `getReducedFraction` to compute the greatest common divisor, which is crucial for reducing the fraction. If there is an error in how the GCD is calculated, it could lead to incorrect results in `getReducedFraction`.\n\n3. **Fraction constructor (int numerator, int denominator)**: This constructor initializes the `Fraction` object. If there is an issue with how the numerator and denominator are set, it could lead to incorrect behavior when calling `getNumerator()` or `getDenominator()`.\n\n4. **getNumerator()**: This method retrieves the numerator of the fraction. If the numerator is not set correctly in the constructor or during reduction, it could lead to the test failure.\n\n5. **getDenominator()**: Similar to `getNumerator()`, this method retrieves the denominator. Any issues in setting the denominator would also contribute to the test failure.\n\n6. **ArithmeticException handling in getReducedFraction**: The handling of the denominator being zero is critical. If the method does not correctly throw an exception or handle edge cases, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n7. **Normalization of zero in getReducedFraction**: The normalization of zero is a specific case that could lead to issues if not handled correctly.\n\n8. **Integer.MIN_VALUE handling in getReducedFraction**: The special case for `Integer.MIN_VALUE` is complex and could lead to errors if not managed properly.\n\n9. **Edge case handling in greatestCommonDivisor**: The logic for handling edge cases in the GCD calculation could also be a source of error.\n\n10. **Overall logic flow in getReducedFraction**: The overall logic and flow of the `getReducedFraction` method, including how it handles various inputs, is critical and could be a source of failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nNote: The method IDs are repeated in the ranking due to the nature of the analysis, where multiple aspects of the same method can contribute to its suspiciousness."
