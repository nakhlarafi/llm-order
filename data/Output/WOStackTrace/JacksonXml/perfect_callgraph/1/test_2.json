The ranking is based on the likelihood that a method may be causing the failure in the test due to its involvement in the deserialization process and handling of empty elements.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 39,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 44,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 88,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 72,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 76,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking considers methods that are directly involved in the deserialization process, particularly those that handle properties and their annotations, as well as methods that manage the state of the parser and the context during XML parsing."
