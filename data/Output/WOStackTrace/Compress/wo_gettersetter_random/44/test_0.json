The constructor itself is the only method covered by this test.\n\nSince there is only one method involved, it will be ranked as the most suspicious. There are no other methods to compare against, so the ranking will only include this method.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
