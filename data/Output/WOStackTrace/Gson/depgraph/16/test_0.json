The ranking is based on the likelihood that a failure in the test could be related to issues in the methods covered.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking considers the complexity and the role of each method in the context of resolving types and adapters, which is central to the test case provided. Methods that directly deal with type resolution and adapter creation are ranked higher due to their critical role in the functionality being tested."
