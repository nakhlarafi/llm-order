The test case is specifically checking for edge cases involving supplementary characters, which may indicate that the method does not handle certain character scenarios correctly.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods based on the provided information:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, there is only one method covered by the test, which is `containsNone`. Since the test is failing, it indicates that this method is likely the most suspicious due to its direct involvement in the test case."
