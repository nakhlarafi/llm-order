    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, we can analyze the method `StringUtils.containsNone` and its relevance to the failing test. The test is specifically checking the behavior of the `containsNone` method when dealing with supplementary characters in a `CharSequence` and a `char[]`. \n\nSince the test is failing, it indicates that there might be an issue with how the `containsNone` method handles these specific cases. Therefore, we can rank the methods based on their potential involvement in the failure.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, there is only one method covered, which is `StringUtils.containsNone`. Since it is directly related to the failing test, it is ranked as the most suspicious."
