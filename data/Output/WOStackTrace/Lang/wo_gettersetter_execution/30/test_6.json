    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided test and its coverage, we need to analyze the methods that are likely involved in the `StringUtils.containsNone` functionality and any related methods that might be indirectly tested or affected by the test cases.\n\nGiven that the test is focused on checking the behavior of `StringUtils.containsNone` with supplementary characters, we can infer that methods related to string comparison, character handling, and index searching are relevant.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods based on their potential involvement in the test and the likelihood of them being the source of the failure:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\nNote: The method IDs are placeholders as the actual method IDs were not provided in the original prompt. The ranking is based on the assumption that methods directly involved in string operations and character handling are more suspicious due to the nature of the test."
