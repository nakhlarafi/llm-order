    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test and method coverage information, we can analyze the methods involved and rank them based on their likelihood of being the source of the failure. The test is specifically focused on the `getReducedFraction` method, which is responsible for reducing fractions and handling edge cases like zero denominators and negative values.\n\nHere are the methods ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Ranking:\n1. **Method ID 1 (`getReducedFraction`)**: This method is directly tested and is responsible for the logic of reducing fractions. Since the test is failing, this method is the most suspicious.\n2. **Method ID 0 (Constructor)**: The constructor initializes the `Fraction` object. If there are issues with how fractions are created (e.g., improper initialization), it could lead to failures in the tests. Thus, it is ranked second.\n3. **Method ID 2 (`greatestCommonDivisor`)**: This method is used within `getReducedFraction` to compute the greatest common divisor. If there are issues with how GCD is calculated, it could affect the reduction process, making it the least suspicious among the three but still relevant. \n\nThe ranking reflects the direct impact of each method on the test's outcome, with the most directly involved method being the most suspicious."
