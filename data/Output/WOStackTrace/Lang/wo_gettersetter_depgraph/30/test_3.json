    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test and method coverage information, we can analyze the methods involved and their potential issues. The test is specifically checking the behavior of the `containsNone` method in the `StringUtils` class when dealing with supplementary characters. \n\nHere are the methods involved:\n\n1. `containsNone(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)` - This method checks if the given `CharSequence` contains any characters from the provided character array. The test is directly calling this method with specific edge cases involving supplementary characters.\n\n2. `containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars)` - This method is a wrapper that converts a `String` of invalid characters into a character array and calls the first method. It indirectly affects the behavior of the first method.\n\nGiven that the test is failing, we can infer that the first method is more suspicious because it directly handles the logic that is being tested. The second method is less suspicious as it merely acts as a wrapper and delegates the actual logic to the first method.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can rank the methods as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nIn this case, we only have two methods to rank, and the first method is the most suspicious due to its direct involvement in the failing test case."
