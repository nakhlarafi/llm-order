    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test and method coverage information, we can analyze the methods to determine their suspiciousness. The test primarily focuses on the `getReducedFraction` method, which is responsible for reducing fractions and handling edge cases like zero denominators and negative values. \n\nThe methods that are most suspicious are those that are directly involved in the logic of `getReducedFraction`, particularly those that handle the numerator and denominator, as well as the greatest common divisor (GCD) calculation. \n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 4 (`getReducedFraction`)**: This method is the primary focus of the test, handling the logic for reducing fractions and managing edge cases.\n2. **Method ID 1 (`greatestCommonDivisor`)**: This method is crucial for reducing fractions, making it highly suspicious if there are issues with fraction reduction.\n3. **Method ID 0 (`getNumerator`)**: This method retrieves the numerator, which is essential for validating the results of the fraction reduction.\n4. **Method ID 3 (`getDenominator`)**: Similar to `getNumerator`, this method retrieves the denominator, which is also critical for the test assertions.\n5. **Method ID 2 (`getDenominator`)**: This method is less suspicious than the others but still plays a role in the overall functionality of the `Fraction` class.\n\nThe remaining methods are ranked lower as they are either less directly involved in the logic tested or are utility methods that are less likely to cause failures in the context of the provided test."
