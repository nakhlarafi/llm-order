The methods that are directly involved in the failure of the test (i.e., those that throw exceptions or are related to the state of the optimizer) are considered more suspicious.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking is based on the likelihood that issues in these methods could lead to the exceptions being thrown in the test case. Methods that handle the state of the optimizer or return results are prioritized."
