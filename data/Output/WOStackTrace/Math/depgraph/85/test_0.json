    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided test and coverage information, we will consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Direct Relevance to the Failing Test**: Methods that are directly involved in the computation of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` are more suspicious.\n2. **Complexity and Error Handling**: Methods that involve complex logic or error handling (like convergence checks) are more likely to have issues.\n3. **Initialization and Configuration**: Methods that set up parameters (like mean and standard deviation) are also important, as incorrect values can lead to failures in calculations.\n\nBased on these criteria, here is the ranking of the methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 6 (getMean)**: Directly returns the mean, which is crucial for the inverse cumulative probability calculation.\n2. **Method ID 7 (getStandardDeviation)**: Returns the standard deviation, another critical parameter for the calculations.\n3. **Method ID 5 (inverseCumulativeProbability)**: This is the method being tested directly, making it highly suspicious.\n4. **Method ID 12 (inverseCumulativeProbability in AbstractContinuousDistribution)**: Involves root finding which can lead to convergence issues.\n5. **Method ID 13 (inverseCumulativeProbability in AbstractContinuousDistribution)**: Similar to Method ID 12, it also deals with root finding.\n6. **Method ID 1 (NormalDistributionImpl constructor)**: Initializes the distribution parameters, which can lead to issues if incorrect values are set.\n7. **Method ID 4 (getInitialDomain)**: Determines the initial domain for calculations, which can affect the results.\n8. **Method ID 3 (getDomainUpperBound)**: Provides the upper bound for the domain, relevant for the calculations.\n9. **Method ID 2 (getDomainLowerBound)**: Provides the lower bound for the domain, also relevant for the calculations.\n10. **Method ID 10 (erf)**: While it is involved in the calculations, it is less directly related to the failing test compared to the others."
