    "final_full_answer": "To determine the most suspicious methods based on the provided test and coverage information, we will analyze the methods that are directly involved in the calculation of the inverse cumulative probability, as this is the focus of the failing test. The methods that are more closely related to the calculation and evaluation of probabilities will be ranked higher in suspicion.\n\nHere is the ranking of the top 10 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 12**: `inverseCumulativeProbability` is the method being tested directly, making it the most suspicious.\n2. **Method ID 14**: Another `inverseCumulativeProbability` method that is likely involved in the calculation.\n3. **Method ID 6**: `cumulativeProbability` is directly related to the probability calculations, making it suspicious.\n4. **Method ID 1**: The constructor for `FDistribution`, which initializes the distribution parameters.\n5. **Method ID 3**: `getNumericalMean` is used in the calculations, making it relevant.\n6. **Method ID 4**: `getNumericalVariance` is also relevant for probability calculations.\n7. **Method ID 5**: `calculateNumericalVariance` is involved in variance calculations, which can affect the results.\n8. **Method ID 10**: `regularizedBeta` is involved in the calculations of probabilities, making it suspicious.\n9. **Method ID 9**: Another `regularizedBeta` method that is likely involved in the calculations.\n10. **Method ID 13**: `solve` method from `UnivariateSolverUtils` is used to find roots, which is part of the inverse calculation process. \n\nThese rankings are based on the direct involvement of the methods in the calculations related to the failing test."
