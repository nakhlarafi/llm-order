    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided test and coverage information, we will analyze the methods that are directly involved in the calculations performed in the test. The test is focused on the `FDistributionImpl` class, particularly its cumulative and inverse cumulative probability methods. \n\nThe methods that are most relevant to the test are those that are called during the execution of `cumulativeProbability` and `inverseCumulativeProbability`. The methods that are directly involved in these calculations will be considered more suspicious if they are not functioning correctly, as they would lead to incorrect results in the test.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods based on their relevance to the test and potential for failure:\n\n1. **Method ID: 1** - `inverseCumulativeProbability(D)D` (Most suspicious as it is directly involved in the test)\n2. **Method ID: 2** - `cumulativeProbability(D)D` (Also directly involved in the test)\n3. **Method ID: 0** - `getInitialDomain(D)D` (Indirectly involved, as it may affect the calculations)\n4. **Method ID: 3** - `<init>(DD)V` (Constructor, important for setting up the state)\n5. **Method ID: 4** - `setNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom(D)V` (Setting degrees of freedom is crucial for calculations)\n6. **Method ID: 5** - `setDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom(D)V` (Similar to above, important for state)\n7. **Method ID: 8** - `regularizedBeta(DDD)D` (Used in cumulative probability calculations)\n8. **Method ID: 12** - `regularizedBeta(DDDDI)D` (Another version of regularized beta, relevant for calculations)\n9. **Method ID: 10** - `logBeta(DDDI)D` (Used in beta function calculations, which are part of the probability calculations)\n10. **Method ID: 11** - `logGamma(D)D` (Used in gamma function calculations, which may affect beta calculations)\n\nNow, here is the output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"method_id\": 1, \"rank\": 1},\n    {\"method_id\": 2, \"rank\": 2},\n    {\"method_id\": 0, \"rank\": 3},\n    {\"method_id\": 3, \"rank\": 4},\n    {\"method_id\": 4, \"rank\": 5},\n    {\"method_id\": 5, \"rank\": 6},\n    {\"method_id\": 8, \"rank\": 7},\n    {\"method_id\": 12, \"rank\": 8},\n    {\"method_id\": 10, \"rank\": 9},\n    {\"method_id\": 11, \"rank\": 10}\n]\n```"
