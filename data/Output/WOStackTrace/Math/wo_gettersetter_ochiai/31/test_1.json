    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided test and method coverage information, we will focus on the methods that are directly involved in the calculation of the inverse cumulative probability, as the test is failing due to inaccurate results from the `ContinuedFraction`. \n\nThe methods that are most likely to be involved in the failure of the test are those that are called during the calculation of the inverse cumulative probability, particularly those that deal with the cumulative probability and variance calculations. \n\nHere is the ranking of the top 10 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 12**: `inverseCumulativeProbability` is directly involved in the test and is the primary method being tested.\n2. **Method ID 14**: Another `inverseCumulativeProbability` method that is likely called within the first one.\n3. **Method ID 3**: `cumulativeProbability` is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability`, making it critical to the test.\n4. **Method ID 1**: `getNumericalVariance` is important for calculating the variance, which is used in the cumulative probability calculations.\n5. **Method ID 2**: `calculateNumericalVariance` is also involved in variance calculations.\n6. **Method ID 0**: `getNumericalMean` is used in the calculations of the cumulative probability.\n7. **Method ID 6**: `getA` is part of the `Beta` class, which is used in the cumulative probability calculations.\n8. **Method ID 7**: `getB` is also part of the `Beta` class, contributing to the cumulative probability.\n9. **Method ID 8**: `regularizedBeta` is involved in the calculations of the cumulative probability.\n10. **Method ID 9**: `logBeta` is used in the calculations related to the Beta function, which is part of the cumulative probability calculations.\n\nThese rankings are based on the direct involvement of the methods in the calculations that lead to the failure of the test."
