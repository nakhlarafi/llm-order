    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided test and coverage information, we will focus on the methods that are directly involved in the functionality being tested, particularly those related to the `FDistributionImpl` class and its methods. The test specifically checks the cumulative and inverse cumulative probability functions, which are critical to the functionality of the `FDistributionImpl` class.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method ID 14** (`inverseCumulativeProbability`): This method is directly tested in the test case, making it the most suspicious.\n2. **Method ID 13** (`cumulativeProbability`): This method is also directly tested, hence it is the second most suspicious.\n3. **Method ID 12** (`FDistributionImpl` constructor): The constructor is crucial for initializing the distribution, making it suspicious as well.\n4. **Method ID 5** (`inverseCumulativeProbability` in `AbstractContinuousDistribution`): This is a superclass method that is overridden, making it relevant to the test.\n5. **Method ID 6** (`logGamma`): This method is used in the calculations of probability distributions, making it relevant.\n6. **Method ID 7** (`regularizedBeta`): This method is part of the calculations for the beta distribution, which is related to the F-distribution.\n7. **Method ID 8** (`regularizedBeta` with more parameters): Similar to ID 7, it is involved in the calculations.\n8. **Method ID 9** (`logBeta`): This method is also involved in the calculations for the beta function.\n9. **Method ID 10** and **Method ID 11**: These methods are part of the `Beta` class and are less directly related to the F-distribution but still play a role in the underlying calculations. They are ranked lower as they are less directly involved in the specific test case."
