    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test and the methods it covers, we can analyze the methods for potential issues. The test checks that the sum of squared errors (SSE) is non-negative after adding data points to the `SimpleRegression` object. \n\nThe methods covered are:\n1. `SimpleRegression()` - the constructor, which initializes the object.\n2. `addData(double x, double y)` - which adds data points to the regression model.\n\nSince the test is specifically checking the behavior of the `getSumSquaredErrors()` method (which is not listed in the covered methods), we can infer that the implementation of `addData` and the internal state management of the `SimpleRegression` class are critical to ensuring that the SSE is calculated correctly.\n\nGiven that the test fails, we can rank the methods based on their relevance to the failure:\n\n1. **addData(double x, double y)** - This method is directly responsible for adding data points, which affects the calculation of SSE. If there is an issue in how data is added or how the internal state is updated, it could lead to incorrect SSE values.\n2. **SimpleRegression()** - While this method initializes the object, if there are issues in the constructor that affect the initial state of the regression model, it could indirectly lead to problems in SSE calculation.\n\nSince we only have two methods covered in the test, we can assume that other methods related to the calculation of SSE (like `getSumSquaredErrors()`) might also be suspicious, but they are not covered in the provided information. Therefore, we will only rank the two methods we have.\n\nHere is the JSON output for the ranking of the methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
