    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided information, we have a failing test that checks if the sum of squared errors (SSE) is non-negative after adding data points to a `SimpleRegression` object. The methods covered by this test are the constructor of `SimpleRegression` and the `addData` method.\n\nTo determine the most suspicious methods, we need to analyze the logic in the `addData` method, as it is responsible for updating the internal state of the regression model. The constructor is less suspicious because it simply initializes the object without any complex logic.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n1. **addData** - This method contains the logic for updating the regression state and is directly involved in the calculation of the sum of squared errors. If there is a bug in how it calculates or updates the values, it could lead to a negative SSE.\n2. **Constructor** - While it initializes the object, it does not perform any calculations that could lead to a negative SSE. However, if there were issues in the initialization of variables that are later used in `addData`, it could indirectly affect the results.\n\nGiven that there are only two methods covered by the test, the ranking will reflect that:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
