The ranking is based on their relevance to the functionality being tested (the `AdamsMoultonIntegrator`), the likelihood of being involved in the failure, and their complexity.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 121,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 120,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 123,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 125,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 122,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 27,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking prioritizes methods that are directly related to the `AdamsMoultonIntegrator` and its integration process, as these are most likely to be involved in the failure observed in the test."
