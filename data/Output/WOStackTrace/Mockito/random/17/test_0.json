The ranking is based on the likelihood that a failure in the test could be traced back to issues in the method's implementation or its interaction with the mocked objects.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking considers the methods that are directly involved in the creation and validation of mocks, particularly those that handle extra interfaces and serialization, as these are the key aspects being tested in the provided test case."
