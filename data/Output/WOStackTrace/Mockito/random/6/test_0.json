The ranking is based on the likelihood that the method could be related to the failure of the test, which is focused on ensuring that null values are not accepted in various matcher methods.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 136,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 69,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 78,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 47,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 227,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 228,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 136 (anyMap)**: Directly related to the matcher that is expected to handle null values.\n2. **Method ID 69 (anyString)**: Similar to anyMap, this method is also a matcher that could be involved in the test failure.\n3. **Method ID 78 (anyObject)**: This method is also a matcher that could be involved in the test failure.\n4. **Method ID 47 (anySet)**: Another matcher that could be involved in the test failure.\n5. **Method ID 227 (anyList)**: This method is a matcher that could be involved in the test failure.\n6. **Method ID 228 (anyCollection)**: Similar to anyList, this method is also a matcher that could be involved in the test failure.\n7. **Method ID 1 (asWrappedMocks)**: This method checks for nulls in collections, which is relevant to the test.\n8. **Method ID 3 (preparedMock)**: This method checks for nulls in mock preparation, which is relevant to the test.\n9. **Method ID 2 (defaultAnswer)**: This method sets a default answer, which could be relevant if the default answer is null.\n10. **Method ID 4 (thenTry)**: This method is part of the stubbing process and could be relevant if it interacts with null values."
