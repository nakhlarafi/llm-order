The ranking is based on their involvement in the test case that failed, particularly focusing on methods related to verification and stubbing, as these are directly relevant to the test's purpose.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be involved in the failure of the test case, particularly those related to the verification of mock interactions and the handling of stubbing."
