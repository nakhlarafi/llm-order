The ranking is based on the likelihood that a failure in the test could be related to issues in the methods covered by the test.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 50,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 49,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 45,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 48,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 47,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 46,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 51,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 43,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 44,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be involved in the failure of the test, particularly those that deal with the verification and management of the symbol table, which is central to the functionality being tested."
