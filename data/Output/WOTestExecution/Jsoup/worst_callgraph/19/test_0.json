    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test case and the methods covered, the following ranking of methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is generated. The ranking is based on the likelihood that a method could be the cause of the test failure, particularly focusing on methods that handle attributes, protocols, and the cleaning process.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 8 (`isSafeAttribute`)**: This method is crucial for determining if an attribute is safe based on the protocols defined. Since the test involves custom protocols, any issue here could directly affect the outcome.\n2. **Method ID 1 (`copySafeNodes`)**: This method is responsible for copying nodes and their attributes, which is central to the cleaning process. If it fails to copy attributes correctly, it could lead to the test failing.\n3. **Method ID 0 (`ElementMeta` constructor)**: This method initializes the `ElementMeta` object, which holds information about the element and discarded attributes. If attributes are not tracked correctly, it could lead to discrepancies in the output.\n4. **Method ID 2 (`clean`)**: This method orchestrates the cleaning process. If there are issues in how it calls other methods or handles the document, it could lead to test failures.\n5. **Method ID 4 (`Cleaner` constructor)**: This method initializes the `Cleaner` with a whitelist. If the whitelist is not set up correctly, it could lead to improper cleaning.\n6. **Method ID 7 (`getEnforcedAttributes`)**: This method retrieves enforced attributes for a tag. If it fails to return the correct attributes, it could affect the cleaning process.\n7. **Method ID 9 (`outerHtmlTail`)**: This method is responsible for generating the outer HTML of an element. If it does not handle the output correctly, it could lead to discrepancies in the final output.\n8. **Method ID 10 (`outerHtmlHead`)**: Similar to the previous method, it generates the opening HTML tags. Any issues here could also affect the output.\n9. **Method ID 5 (`equals`)**: This method checks equality between `TypedValue` objects. While it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure, any issues in equality checks could lead to unexpected behavior.\n10. **Method ID 6 (`hashCode`)**: This method generates a hash code for `TypedValue`. Similar to the previous method, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure but could contribute to unexpected behavior in collections."
