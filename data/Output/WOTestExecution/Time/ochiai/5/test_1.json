    "final_full_answer": "To determine the most suspicious methods based on the provided test and coverage information, we need to analyze the methods that are directly involved in the `normalizedStandard` method and the assertions made in the test. The test checks the behavior of the `normalizedStandard` method, which is responsible for normalizing the period based on the specified `PeriodType`.\n\nThe following methods are particularly relevant:\n\n1. **normalizedStandard** - This is the method being tested directly.\n2. **withYears** - This method is called within `normalizedStandard` to adjust the years.\n3. **getYears** and **getMonths** - These methods are used to retrieve the current years and months from the period.\n4. **safeAdd** - This method is used to safely add years and months, and it could potentially throw an exception if there's an overflow.\n5. **getValues** - This method is used to get the values of the period, which is crucial for understanding how the period is constructed.\n6. **setIndexedField** - This method is involved in setting the values for the period, which could affect the outcome of the normalization.\n7. **getIndexedField** - This method retrieves the indexed field values, which are used in the calculations.\n8. **<init>** methods for Period - The constructors for the `Period` class are important as they define how a `Period` object is created.\n9. **checkAndUpdate** - This method checks and updates the values for the period, which is relevant for ensuring the integrity of the period's data.\n10. **indexOf** - This method is used to find the index of a specific duration field type, which is relevant for the normalization process.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be involved in the failure of the test based on their roles in the `normalizedStandard` method and the assertions made in the test."
