    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test, stack trace, and covered methods, we can analyze the situation to determine which methods are most suspicious regarding the failure of the test.\n\n1. **getSumSquaredErrors()**: This method is directly involved in the assertion that failed. The test checks if the result of this method is non-negative. If it returns a negative value, it would cause the assertion to fail, making it the most suspicious method.\n\n2. **addData(double x, double y)**: This method is responsible for adding data points to the regression model. If there is an issue with how data is being added (e.g., incorrect calculations of sums or averages), it could lead to incorrect results in `getSumSquaredErrors()`. Therefore, it is also quite suspicious.\n\n3. **SimpleRegression()**: The constructor initializes the regression object. While it is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure, if there were issues with initialization (e.g., not setting initial values correctly), it could indirectly affect the calculations in the other methods. However, it is the least suspicious of the three.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n```"
