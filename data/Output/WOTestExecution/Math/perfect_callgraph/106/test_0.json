    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test and method coverage information, the following analysis can be made:\n\n1. The test `testParseProperInvalidMinus` is designed to check the behavior of the `parse` method in handling invalid fractions with negative signs in improper fractions. The test expects a `ParseException` to be thrown when invalid input is provided.\n\n2. The method `org.apache.commons.math.fraction.ProperFractionFormat:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/text/ParsePosition;)` is directly involved in parsing the input string and is responsible for handling the logic that determines whether the input is valid or not. This method is highly suspicious because it is the one that is expected to throw the `ParseException` when invalid input is encountered.\n\n3. The method `org.apache.commons.math.fraction.FractionFormat:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)` is also suspicious as it calls the `parse` method of `ProperFractionFormat` and handles the result. If the `parse` method does not behave as expected, this method will also fail.\n\n4. The constructor `org.apache.commons.math.fraction.Fraction:<init>(II)V` is less suspicious but still relevant because it handles the creation of a `Fraction` object, which could be indirectly affected by the parsing logic.\n\n5. The methods related to parsing and formatting (like `getNumeratorFormat`, `getDenominatorFormat`, etc.) are less suspicious but could still play a role in the overall parsing process.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' involvement in the parsing process and their potential to cause the test to fail based on the provided input."
