    "final_full_answer": "To rank the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious based on the provided test and method coverage, we will consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Direct Coverage**: Methods that are directly called by the test are more suspicious if the test fails.\n2. **Indirect Coverage**: Methods that are indirectly called through other methods are less suspicious but still relevant.\n3. **Complexity**: Methods that contain more complex logic or have multiple branches may be more prone to errors.\n4. **Error Handling**: Methods that handle exceptions or have conditions that could lead to exceptions are also more suspicious.\n\nGiven the test `testMath280`, which checks the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of `NormalDistributionImpl`, we will focus on methods related to this functionality.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Ranking:\n1. **Method ID 0**: `inverseCumulativeProbability` is the method directly tested, making it the most suspicious.\n2. **Method ID 11**: The overridden `inverseCumulativeProbability` in the abstract class is also directly related to the test.\n3. **Method ID 9**: The `bracket` method is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability`, making it crucial for the test's success.\n4. **Method ID 8**: The root-finding function is essential for the calculation in `inverseCumulativeProbability`.\n5. **Method ID 4**: The `getDomainUpperBound` method is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability`, affecting its output.\n6. **Method ID 6**: The `getInitialDomain` method is also called, which influences the root-finding process.\n7. **Method ID 5**: The `getDomainLowerBound` method is relevant for the bounds used in the root-finding.\n8. **Method ID 7**: The `getDomainLowerBound` method is called, which is part of the domain checks.\n9. **Method ID 15**: The `cumulativeProbability` method is called within the root-finding function, making it relevant.\n10. **Method ID 24**: The constructor of `NormalDistributionImpl` is less suspicious but still relevant as it sets up the state of the object."
