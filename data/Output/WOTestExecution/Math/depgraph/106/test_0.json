    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test and method coverage information, we can analyze the methods involved in the parsing of fractions and their potential issues. The test specifically checks for invalid fractions with negative signs in improper fractions, which suggests that methods responsible for parsing and validating the fraction format are the most suspicious.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 1**: This method is directly responsible for parsing the fraction and is where the invalid minus sign handling should occur.\n2. **Method ID 0**: This method is also involved in parsing and is called by the first method, making it crucial for the parsing logic.\n3. **Method ID 2**: This method wraps the parsing logic and throws exceptions for unparseable fractions, making it relevant to the test case.\n4. **Method ID 8**: This method handles whitespace parsing, which is important for correctly interpreting the fraction format.\n5. **Method ID 4**: This method retrieves the denominator format, which is essential for parsing fractions.\n6. **Method ID 5**: Similar to Method ID 4, but for the numerator format, making it equally important.\n7. **Method ID 3**: This method retrieves the whole number format, which is part of the fraction parsing.\n8. **Method ID 6**: This method constructs the Fraction object and checks for invalid states (like zero denominator), which is relevant but less directly tied to the parsing logic.\n9. **Method ID 12**: This method is a constructor for FractionFormat, which is less suspicious but still part of the overall parsing setup.\n10. **Method ID 11**: This method deals with sign handling, which is relevant but less directly tied to the parsing failure in this specific test case. \n\nThe methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in parsing and validating the fraction format, particularly in relation to the handling of invalid inputs as specified in the test case."
