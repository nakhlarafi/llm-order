    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test and the methods covered, the following ranking of methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is generated. The ranking is based on the likelihood that a method could be the cause of the test failure, particularly focusing on methods related to stubbing, argument matching, and invocation handling, as these are central to the functionality being tested.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 64,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 67,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 65,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking prioritizes methods that are directly involved in the stubbing and invocation processes, as these are critical to the behavior being tested in the `shouldRemoveAllStubbing` test."
