The ranking is based on their involvement in the stack trace and their relevance to the failure, particularly focusing on the `UnsupportedOperationException` that occurred during the verification process.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 59,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 37,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 49,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 42,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 56,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 90,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 89,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 59**: This method is directly involved in creating verification data, which is crucial for the verification process that failed.\n2. **Method ID 12**: This method checks the number of invocations, which is relevant to the verification failure.\n3. **Method ID 37**: This method is responsible for starting the verification process, making it critical in the context of the failure.\n4. **Method ID 49**: This method checks for missing invocations, which could relate to the verification failure.\n5. **Method ID 42**: This method validates matchers, which is relevant to the argument matching that could lead to the exception.\n6. **Method ID 56**: This method binds matchers to invocations, which is part of the verification process.\n7. **Method ID 90**: This method checks if the invocation matches, which is essential for verification.\n8. **Method ID 89**: This method marks invocations as verified, which is part of the verification process.\n9. **Method ID 14**: This method checks for missing invocations, which could be related to the verification failure.\n10. **Method ID 6**: This method handles the answer for invocations, which could indirectly relate to the verification process. \n\nThe methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the verification process and their potential to cause the `UnsupportedOperationException`."
