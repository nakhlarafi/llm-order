The ranking is based on their involvement in the stubbing and invocation process, particularly in relation to the failure of the test.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 48,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be involved in the failure of the test due to their roles in handling stubbing and argument matching, particularly with varargs, which is central to the test case."
