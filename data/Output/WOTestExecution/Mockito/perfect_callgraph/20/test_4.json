The ranking is based on the likelihood that they could be related to the failure of the test case, particularly focusing on the creation and handling of mocks and spies, especially for abstract classes.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 63,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 122,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 71,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 68,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking prioritizes methods that are directly involved in the mock creation process, particularly those that handle abstract classes or involve the spy functionality, as these are critical to the test case that is failing."
