The ranking is based on their involvement in the stubbing and invocation process, particularly in relation to the failing test case that involves varargs and mixed arguments.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 51,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 43,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 56,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 39,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 101,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods that are most likely to be involved in the issues related to the stubbing and invocation of methods with varargs, particularly in the context of the test that is failing."
