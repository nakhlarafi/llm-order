The new methods covered are related to the mocking process and the handling of ongoing stubbing, which are relevant to the test failure.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking of the top 10 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"method_id\": 110, \"rank\": 1},\n    {\"method_id\": 107, \"rank\": 2},\n    {\"method_id\": 128, \"rank\": 3},\n    {\"method_id\": 145, \"rank\": 4},\n    {\"method_id\": 133, \"rank\": 5},\n    {\"method_id\": 150, \"rank\": 6},  // Newly added method related to ongoing stubbing\n    {\"method_id\": 100, \"rank\": 7},\n    {\"method_id\": 101, \"rank\": 8},\n    {\"method_id\": 102, \"rank\": 9},\n    {\"method_id\": 151, \"rank\": 10}   // Newly added method related to varargs\n]\n```\n\nIn this ranking, the newly covered methods (IDs 150 and 151) have been placed in the 6th and 10th positions, respectively, as they are relevant to the mocking process but less directly related to the specific failure of the test compared to the previously ranked methods."
