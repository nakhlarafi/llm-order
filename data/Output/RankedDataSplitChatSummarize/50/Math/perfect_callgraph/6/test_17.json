    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided coverage information and the previously ranked methods, I will analyze the new methods and their relevance to the `testCigarWithBoundaries` failure. The focus will be on methods that are likely involved in the optimization process, matrix operations, and parameter checks, as these are critical in determining the behavior of the `CMAESOptimizer`.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated ranking of the top 10 most suspicious methods in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 171,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 156,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 170,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 155,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 154,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 151,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 150,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 172,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 169,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 157,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Rankings:\n1. **Method ID 171 (`CMAESOptimizer:updateCovariance`)**: This method is crucial for updating the covariance matrix, which is central to the CMA-ES algorithm.
