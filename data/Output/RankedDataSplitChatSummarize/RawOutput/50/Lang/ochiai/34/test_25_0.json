    "final_full_answer": "To determine the most suspicious methods based on the provided test failure and stack trace, we need to analyze the context of the failure and the methods involved in the test. The test `testReflectionIntArrayArray` is failing because it expected a `<null>` value but received an empty string `{}` instead. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how null values are being handled in the `ToStringBuilder` or `ReflectionToStringBuilder` classes.\n\nHere are the methods that are most relevant to the failure:\n\n1. **`reflectionAppendArray`** (Method ID: 1) - This method is responsible for appending array details to the string representation. Since the test involves an array and the failure is related to null handling, this method is highly suspicious.\n\n2. **`toString`** (Method ID: 0) - This method is the entry point for converting an object to a string representation. It calls other methods, including `reflectionAppendArray`, making it crucial in the context of the failure.\n\n3. **`reflectionToString`** (Method ID: 9) - This method is a public static method that calls `ReflectionToStringBuilder.toString`. It is directly involved in the test and could be a source of the issue.\n\n4. **`appendNullText`** (Method ID: 29) - This method is responsible for appending a text representation for null values. Since the test is failing due to a null value not being handled correctly, this method is also suspicious.\n\n5. **`getStyle`** (Method ID: 11) - This method retrieves the style used for string representation. If the style is not set correctly, it could lead to incorrect handling of null values.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
