    "final_full_answer": "To determine the most suspicious methods based on the provided stack trace and the failing test, we need to analyze the methods involved in the stack trace and their relationships to the test case.\n\n1. **Stack Trace Analysis**:\n   - The exception `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid endpoint parameters: lowerBound=0.0 initial=-1.0 upperBound=1.7976931348623157E308` indicates that there is an issue with the parameters being passed to the `bracket` method in `UnivariateRealSolverUtils`.\n   - The method `inverseCumulativeProbability` in `FDistributionImpl` is directly involved in the call that leads to the exception, as it calls `bracket` from `UnivariateRealSolverUtils`.\n\n2. **Method Relationships**:\n   - The `inverseCumulativeProbability` method is crucial because it is the method being tested and is directly responsible for the exception.\n   - The `bracket` method is also suspicious because it is where the exception is thrown.\n   - The `getDomainLowerBound` and `getDomainUpperBound` methods are involved in determining the bounds for the `bracket` method, making them relevant as well.\n   - The `getInitialDomain` method is also involved in the calculation of the initial value for the `bracket` method.\n\n3. **Ranking**:\n   - The most suspicious method is `inverseCumulativeProbability` since it is the method under test and directly leads to the exception.\n   - Next is `bracket`, as it is where the exception is thrown.\n   - Following that, `getDomainLowerBound` and `getDomainUpperBound` are suspicious because they provide the bounds for the `bracket` method.\n   - Finally, `getInitialDomain` is ranked as it contributes to the initial value used in the `bracket` method.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the top 5 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' involvement in the failure and their potential to cause the issue observed in the test."
