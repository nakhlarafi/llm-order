    "final_full_answer": "To determine the most suspicious methods based on the provided stack trace and the failing test, we need to analyze the methods involved in the stack trace and their relationships to the test case. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs due to an `IllegalArgumentException` related to invalid endpoint parameters during the execution of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method.\n\nHere\u2019s the analysis of the methods involved:\n\n1. **`inverseCumulativeProbability(double p)`** (Method ID: 13) - This method is directly involved in the stack trace and is where the failure occurs. It calls the `bracket` method, which leads to the exception. This method is highly suspicious.\n\n2. **`AbstractContinuousDistribution:inverseCumulativeProbability(double p)`** (Method ID: 14) - This method is a superclass method that is called by the `FDistributionImpl`'s `inverseCumulativeProbability`. It is also directly related to the failure, making it suspicious.\n\n3. **`UnivariateRealSolverUtils:bracket(UnivariateRealFunction, double, double, double)`** (Method ID: 15) - This method is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and is where the exception is thrown. It is highly suspicious as it directly leads to the failure.\n\n4. **`getDomainLowerBound(double p)`** (Method ID: 21) - This method is called to get the lower bound for the `bracket` method. If it returns an incorrect value, it could lead to the invalid parameters that cause the exception. Thus, it is suspicious.\n\n5. **`getDomainUpperBound(double p)`** (Method ID: 18) - Similar to the lower bound method, this method provides the upper bound for the `bracket` method. If it returns an incorrect value, it could also contribute to the invalid parameters. Therefore, it is also suspicious.\n\nBased on this analysis, here are the top 5 most suspicious methods ranked:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
