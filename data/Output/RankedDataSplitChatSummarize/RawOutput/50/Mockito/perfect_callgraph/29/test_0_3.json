The newly covered methods, particularly **MockHandler.handle** and **MockingProgressImpl.mockingStarted**, are ranked lower but still relevant due to their roles in handling mock invocations and managing the mocking state.\n5. **VerificationDataImpl.assertWantedIsVerifiable** is included as it relates to the verification process and could contribute to the failure.\n\nThis ranking reflects the methods' involvement in the context of the NullPointerException and their potential impact on the test's failure."
