    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided stack trace and the context of the failing test, we can analyze the methods involved and their relevance to the failure. The failure is due to a `NoSuchMethodError`, which indicates that the method being called does not exist in the expected form. This is likely related to the mocking framework's handling of method calls on mocked objects.\n\nHere are the top 5 most suspicious methods ranked based on their involvement in the stack trace and their relation to the failure:\n\n1. **Method ID: 0** - `org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:callRealMethod()Ljava/lang/Object;`\n   - This method is directly involved in the invocation that leads to the error. It attempts to call the real method on the mock, which is where the failure occurs.\n\n2. **Method ID: 45** - `org.mockito.internal.invocation.realmethod.FilteredCGLIBProxyRealMethod:invoke(Ljava/lang/Object;[Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;`\n   - This method is responsible for invoking the real method on the proxy. Since the error occurs during this invocation, it is highly suspicious.\n\n3. **Method ID: 7** - `org.mockito.internal.invocation.realmethod.CGLIBProxyRealMethod:invoke(Ljava/lang/Object;[Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;`\n   - Similar to the previous method, this one is also involved in invoking the real method on the proxy and is part of the stack trace leading to the error.\n\n4. **Method ID: 44** - `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.StubbedInvocationMatcher:answer(Lorg/mockito/invocation/InvocationOnMock;)Ljava/lang/Object;`\n   - This method is responsible for providing the answer to the invocation. If the answer is not set up correctly, it could lead to the method not being found.\n\n5. **Method ID: 1** - `org.mockito.Mockito:withSettings()Lorg/mockito/MockSettings;`\n   - This method is used to configure the mock settings. If the settings are not correctly defined, it could lead to issues when trying to call real methods on mocks.\n\nHere is the JSON output for the top 5 most suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 45,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 44,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
