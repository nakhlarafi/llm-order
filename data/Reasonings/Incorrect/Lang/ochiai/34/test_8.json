However, I did not sufficiently consider the implications of how the registry interacts with the overall string representation logic.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Neglecting the role of the `ToStringStyle` methods\",\n            \"description\": \"I overlooked the importance of methods related to `ToStringStyle`, particularly `isRegistered` and `appendDetail`, which directly influence how objects are represented in the string output. These methods are critical in determining whether an object is treated as registered or not, which is central to the test failure.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Insufficient analysis of the stack trace context\",\n            \"description\": \"While I noted the stack trace, I did not adequately analyze how the methods involved in the stack trace relate to the expected output.
