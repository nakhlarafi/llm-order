However, I failed to consider that the actual bug was related to the handling of integer overflow in the greatestCommonDivisor method (method ID 0), which is called within getReducedFraction. The test case's failure was due to an incorrect expectation of the result from the getReducedFraction method, which was influenced by the behavior of greatestCommonDivisor.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Overemphasis on direct assertions\",\n            \"description\": \"I focused on the methods that had direct assertions in the test case, assuming they were more likely to contain bugs. This led to overlooking the underlying logic in greatestCommonDivisor, which is crucial for the correct functioning of getReducedFraction. The failure in the test case was a result of an arithmetic issue that stemmed from the gcd calculation, not from the assertions themselves.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Neglecting the impact of edge cases\",\n            \"description\": \"I did not adequately consider how edge cases, such as integer overflow and negative values, could affect the calculations in greatestCommonDivisor.
